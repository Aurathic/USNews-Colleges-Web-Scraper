Through its commitment to ensuring all students can graduate with little or no debt, all students who are accepted can rely on Princeton's financial aid program to meet their financial need so they can attend and thrive at the University. More than ever, Princeton seeks to enroll the most talented students from a broad spectrum of cultural, ethnic and economic backgrounds. Students' experiences inside and outside the classroom prepare them for service, leadership and lifelong learning. Princeton emphasizes creativity, innovation and collaboration with a program of liberal arts in the humanities, arts, social sciences, natural sciences and engineering. Princeton's low student-to-faculty ratio means students are able to develop close working relationships with professors, who are leaders in their fields. We expect every faculty member to teach, and we expect every student to do original, creative research. Our approximately 5,300 undergraduate students are part of a vibrant campus community, and students stay connected to a Princeton community that spans the globe long after they have graduated. Students are encouraged to explore many academic and extracurricular opportunities while taking advantage of the University's extraordinary facilities and resources. We are a community of learning that is enriched by the varied experiences and perspectives of and engagement between our students, faculty and staff. Classrooms are filled with students and faculty from a wide range of backgrounds from across the country and around the world, and students benefit from the interdisciplinary connections at the core of Princeton's curriculum.

the over 6,000 undergraduates studying in Columbia College and The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science.  The renowned Core Curriculum unites all Columbia undergraduates by providing a common foundation in literature, philosophy, science, art, history and music, and caps classes at 22 students to afford close interaction with Columbias renowned faculty. Columbia Engineering is one of the oldest engineering schools in the U.S., developing future engineering leaders through its unique educational approach which includes a first-year hands-on design course; close student-to-faculty interaction with extensive undergraduate research opportunities starting as early as the first year; a broad-based core curriculum, liberal arts minors and interdisciplinary courses; programs and projects that foster entrepreneurship and socially-responsible innovation; and trailblazing internship and civic engagement programs in New York City and around the world. Students choose among over 100 majors and concentrations and thousands of research, internship and job opportunities.Located in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, Columbia not only offers access to all of New York City, the ultimate classroom, but also guaranteed four-year housing within a traditional campus surrounded by a residential neighborhood lined with bookstores, cafes and parks. Called \"the quintessential great urban university,\" Columbia is diverse in every way: students come from 50 states and over 100 foreign countries; over half of undergraduates are students of color, and over 300 student organizations are offered, including 34 Division I Ivy League athletic teams and dozens of community service organizations, performance groups, political clubs and publications.As the birthplace of FM radio, the fields of genetics and anthropology, the nations oldest literary magazine and first Black student advocacy group on a multi-racial campus, Columbia has carried on a tradition of both social and scientific innovation for over 250 years. Notable Columbians include Barack Obama, Isaac Asimov, Madeline Albright, Langston Hughes, Jack Kerouac, Julia Stiles, and many more spanning every professional field. Columbia offers extensive need-based financial aid and meets the full need of every student admitted as a first-year with grants instead of loans. Parents with calculated incomes below $60,000 and with typical assets are not expected to contribute any income or assets to tuition, room, board and mandatory fees and families with calculated incomes between $60,000 and $100,000 and with typical assets have a significantly reduced contribution. To support students pursuing study abroad, research, internships and community service opportunities, Columbia offers the opportunity to apply for additional funding and exemptions from academic year and summer work expectations. A commitment to diversity of every kind is a longstanding Columbia hallmark.

While MIT is a research university committed to world-class inquiry in math, science, and engineering, MIT has equally distinguished programs in architecture, the humanities, management, and the social sciences. A diverse, supportive campus environment--with an incredible range of student groups and athletic and fitness opportunities--ensures that it's not all about the work. And in MIT's intensely creative atmosphere, the arts flourish in all their forms.MIT admits some of the most talented students in the world on a need-blind basis. The Institute is committed to meeting the financial need of each admitted undergraduate student through MIT Scholarships; the estimated average need-based scholarship is $54,601 in 2021-2022. As a result, the MIT community is incredibly diverse, and organically collaborative, with students coming from many different backgrounds, across the country and around the world.Students are frequently encouraged to unite MIT's engineering excellence with public service. For example, the required senior capstone design course for mechanical engineering majors centers on making the world a better place through engineering. Recent years have focused on projects using alternative forms of energy, and machines that could be used for sustainable agriculture. Beyond academic coursework, MIT's D-Lab, Poverty Action Lab, and Public Service Center all support students and professors in the research and implementation of culturally sensitive and environmentally responsible technologies and programs that alleviate poverty and improve quality of life in low-income areas locally, nationally, and worldwide.MIT's preeminence in entrepreneurship is rooted in its founding. As one of the first land-grant colleges, the Institute was designed to deliver a practical education rather than to focus on the classical education that was provided by many private universities of the era. This emphasis on practice is infused into the entrepreneurship curriculum and programming, which emphasizes learning by doing. Over the course of the 2018-2019 academic year, more than 85 entrepreneurship courses were offered.Several MIT departments, labs, and centers foster entrepreneurship and innovation at MIT including the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship, the MIT Sandbox Innovation Fund Program, and the MIT Innovation Initiative to name a few. MIT also has more than 35 student clubs and initiatives involved in entrepreneurship or innovation, among them the MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition, MIT Clean Energy Prize, and conferences such as Hacking Arts and Hacking Medicine.The MIT community brings its energy and creativity outside the classroom as well with 450+ student-run groups, 33 varsity sports, 18 intramural sports, 35 club sports, and more than 50 music, theater, visual arts, writing, and dance groups. It's just a short walk across the Charles River to Boston where students can enjoy the city's fabulous restaurants and culture. Many programs around MIT allow students to get reduced-price tickets to various events, including the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the American Repertory Theater, and Bruins, Celtics, and Red Sox games. Students get free admission daily to the Museum of Science, the Museum of Fine Arts, and all Harvard University and MIT museums.", "totalUndergrads": 4361, "totalGradsAndPros": 6893, "pctPell": 19, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 52, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 48}, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 20, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 80}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", "99%"], ["women's dorms", ""], ["sorority housing", ""], ["fraternity housing", ""], ["apartments for married students", ""], ["apartment for single students", ""], ["special housing for disabled students", ""], ["cooperative housing", ""], ["theme housing", ""], ["other housing options", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 39, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 61}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 26, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 74}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Offered on campus", "csAvgCost": 16636, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 4535, "nptMed1": 1820, "nptMed2": 6049, "nptHi1": 14381, "nptHi2": 38934}, "netPriceCalculator": "https://npc.collegeboard.org/student/app/mit", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 12500, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 5500, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 6993, "mdIncDebtMdn": 6155, "hiIncDebtMdn": 13000}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 119, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 22735, "pctIncuredDebt": 21, "vGiBill": 1, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 9, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 168, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "placement service", "day care", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Dedicated teaching laboratories in many departments are complemented by the facilities of numerous interdisciplinary research laboratories and centers including MIT.nano, Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, MIT Media Lab, SENSEable City Lab, Nuclear Reactor Lab, and the Wright Brothers Wind Tunnel.

Students of all backgrounds, beliefs, identities, and interests join a global intellectual community that values a multifaceted approach to undergraduate education. All undergraduates are enrolled in a single liberal arts college at the heart of the university, offering nearly 2,000 courses and 80 majors. Students begin their academic journey undeclared, with access to all the same courses, and without the restrictions of a core curriculum. Every incoming first-year student is randomly assigned to one of fourteen Residential Colleges. These close-knit communities, housed in stunning buildings centered on green courtyards serve as microcosms of Yale's diverse student population, while preserving the intimacy of a smaller college experience. Yale students mount over 250 theatrical and musical performances each year; write for dozens undergraduate publications; celebrate their identities through numerous religious and cultural groups; and compete on nearly 100 varsity, club, and intramural athletic teams. Students travel to more than 50 foreign countries annually, engaging in scholarship, research, and public service through more than 1,000 internship, fellowship, research, and study abroad opportunities.

son, Leland Junior. Their intent was to establish a \"University of high degree\" that would \"qualify students for personal success and direct usefulness in life and promote the public welfare by exercising an influence on behalf of humanity and civilization.\" Today, Stanford is a leading research university where teaching, learning and research are integral to the university's mission. Stanford values close interaction between undergraduates and faculty. Undergraduate student participation in research is strongly supported and, in 2019-2020, Stanford allocated about $5.9 million to support more than 800 students on a wide range of projects, even with restrictions on travel and on-campus activities. Stanford's entrepreneurial spirit draws from its location on the West Coast and the legacy of its founders. Stanford emphasizes multidisciplinary approaches to teaching and research, and academic excellence crosses disciplines, ranging from humanities to social sciences to engineering and the sciences.  Current faculty members have earned 19 Nobel Prizes and four Pulitzer Prizes. Since the university's founding, 34 Stanford faculty have won the Nobel Prize. Students, distinguished by initiative, love of learning and commitment to public service, are accomplished in many areas including academics, art, music and athletics. Stanford's athletic teams, called the Cardinal, have won the Directors Cup as the best program nationwide 25 years in a row. Stanford's extraordinary campus is located in a dynamic and diverse area between San Francisco and San Jose in Northern California. The campus is both beautiful and environmentally sustainable. The Bing Overseas Studies Program has offerings in Australia, Berlin, Cape Town, Florence, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Kyoto, Madrid, New York, Oxford, Paris and Santiago. Other Stanford programs take students to the Hopkins Marine Station on Monterey Bay, New York City and Washington D.C. The arts are emphasized at Stanford and a vibrant arts district includes Bing Concert Hall, the McMurtry Building for Art and Art History, Cantor Arts Center and the Anderson Collection at Stanford University.

Penn also offers an array of exciting interdisciplinary programs and courses which leverage the resources of different departments or schools, such as the Fisher Program in Management and Technology, the Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business, and the Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management. Students are strongly encouraged to engage the world beyond Penn, both locally and globally. Civic House provides a \"hub\" for students interested in all kinds of community service while the Center for Community Partnerships coordinates over 150 Academically Based Community Service courses each term which link theory and practice through activities that make a significant difference in West Philadelphia and the City. Opportunities for global engagement include Penn Abroad, through which more than 600 Penn undergraduates each year spend a semester or longer abroad, more than any other Ivy League school. Nearly 15% of our undergraduates come to Penn from other countries, providing a linguistically and culturally diverse environment. As one of the worlds premier research universities, Penn offers students the opportunity to learn by participating in the hands-on creation of new knowledge. The Center for Undergraduate Research, the Kelly Writers House, the Weiss Tech House, and the Penn Museum are places that connect undergraduates to leading researchers at Penn and to the cutting-edge ideas of its laboratories and seminar rooms. The academic experience at Penn is integrated with social and extra-curricular life. Almost all first-year students reside within the eleven College Houses at Penn, which link intellectual and social experiences through close contact with faculty-in-residence and student resident assistants. Penn has over 300 student groups ranging from political action to performing arts to sports clubs to student publications offering all students opportunities to pursue a wide-range of interests. Such opportunities extend beyond campus to the City of Philadelphia where students can experience the rich cultural, athletic, social, and political life of Americas most historic city.

A private comprehensive teaching and research university, Duke traces its roots to 1838, officially becoming Duke University in 1924. In addition to liberal arts and engineering education at the undergraduate level, Duke offers graduate and professional study in arts and sciences, business, divinity, engineering, the environment, law, public policy, medicine, and nursing. At the same time, Duke is an intimate setting, with 6,700 undergraduates and an additional 9,000 graduate and professional students.Duke is a global university with students and faculty from nearly every country. We encourage students to go abroad to study, perform service and conduct research. About half of Dukes graduating class spends at least a semester in another country - one of the highest percentages of any of the nations top private research universities. We offer instruction in 25 foreign languages. One of our most popular programs is DukeEngage, which supports undergraduates who want to pursue an immersive service experience in the U.S. or abroad.       Duke is characterized by innovation, entrepreneurship, energy and ambition. Duke students have an unusually wide range of opportunities available to them and freedom in choosing the academic path that best meets their needs.  Duke students are encouraged to make a difference, to experiment with ideas and organizations and they are challenged to become engaged with society's problems and solutions.     Our students spend four years on one of the most beautiful campuses in America -- soaring Gothic buildings, modern teaching and research facilities, lush botanical gardens, and accessible athletics and recreational spaces.  Dukes home of Durham is a historic tobacco and textile hub that has emerged as the heart of North Carolinas hi-tech Research Triangle, and is consistently recognized as one of the most desirable and vibrant places to live in the country.  Durham's arts, culture, recreation and restaurants have earned a national following, and the region provides numerous opportunities for post-graduate employment.      Duke students exhibit legendary passion and enthusiasm.  Dukes athletic program is regularly ranked among the nations strongest and most competitive, with some of the countrys most talented scholar-athletes and dedicated fans: the Cameron Crazies. A member of the Atlantic Coast Conference, Duke has thirteen men's varsity teams and thirteen women's varsity teams as well as numerous intramural, recreational, and club sports. Duke consistently leads the ACC in Academic Honor Roll students and is a top producer of Academic All Americans.       The residential experience is an important component of a Duke education. About 85 percent of all undergraduates live on campus. First-year students live together on East Campus, where about a quarter of them participate in FOCUS, a living/learning program organized around academic themes, which gives them immediate access to faculty mentoring and a smaller community of students they get to know well.      Duke is one of a small number of schools committed to a need-blind admission policy, which means we admit undergraduates without consideration of a family's ability to pay tuition and other college costs and meet 100 percent of a students demonstrated financial need for four years. About 54 percent of our undergraduates receive some sort of financial assistance, including need-based aid, merit or athletic scholarships.     With the rigorous academics, the plethora of social and artistic activities, the immersive service and cultural opportunities and the occasional basketball game in Cameron Indoor Stadium, the most important things students need to bring with them to Duke are energy and intellectual curiosity.", "totalUndergrads": 6717, "totalGradsAndPros": 9455, "pctPell": 13, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 50, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 50}, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": null, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": null}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", ""], ["women's dorms", ""], ["men's dorms", ""], ["apartment for single students", ""], ["theme housing", ""], ["wellness housing", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 0, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 0}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 0, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 0}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Offered on campus", "csAvgCost": 27020, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": -7808, "nptMed1": -1314, "nptMed2": 4150, "nptHi1": 18375, "nptHi2": 48680}, "netPriceCalculator": "https://npc.collegeboard.org/student/app/duke", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 12582, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 5500, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 12750, "mdIncDebtMdn": 11500, "hiIncDebtMdn": 12000}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 120, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 24219, "pctIncuredDebt": 30, "vGiBill": 0, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 29, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["women's center", "placement service", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Student patrols", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Nasher Art Museum", "vProServAva": [], "vGuiSpePgm": ["tape recorders", "tutors", "adaptive equipment", "reader services", "braille services"], "guidnceCmpsAcsblty": "Mostly"}, {"primaryKey": "2077", "xwalkId": "162928", "urlName": "jhu", "displayName": "Johns Hopkins University", "shortName": "JHU", "city": "Baltimore", "state": "MD", "zip": "21218", "website": "http://www.jhu.edu", "streetAddress1": "3400 N.

The university emphasizes the importance of exploration and discovery in the undergraduate experience. Learning occurs through hands-on experiences across all academic disciplines and within every subject imaginable. The lack of a core curriculum fosters academic freedom, which allows students to create their own interdisciplinary paths. They choose classes they are genuinely interested in, not just required to take, so there's a real sense of curiosity around learning that extends beyond the classroom setting. More than 60 percent of Hopkins students double major or minor, often creating unique combinations like electrical engineering and romance languages or biomedical engineering and business. This establishes a dynamic, engaging learning environment where students from various backgrounds bring different perspectives to class discussions. Collaborative learning is fundamental to the academic environment and many spaces on campus are designed to foster collaboration across disciplines. State-of-the-art facilities such as the Undergraduate Teaching Labs or JHU-MICA Film Center also give students access to the latest learning technology. Hopkins professors, another invaluable resource, are experts in their fields who make important contributions to their industries and academia at large. They're enthusiastic about teaching and often include undergraduates in their own ground-breaking research. Students get to know their professors and classmates the way they would at a small liberal arts college but have all of the opportunities of a major research institution with a global reach. As a part of this community, undergraduates not only work alongside experts who share their interests but also run with projects of their own design. In fact, the university remains a national leader of research funding and students in all programs within the Krieger School of Arts & Sciences and Whiting School of Engineering gain practical experiences through research conducted both on and off campus. Several funded programs, such as the Provost's Undergraduate Research Awards and the Woodrow Wilson Undergraduate Research Fellowship, are dedicated to supporting undergraduate research. Students also encounter real-world experiences--like implementing marketing plans for local companies and heading startup businesses on campus--through the Center for Leadership Education and classes in business, marketing and communications, accounting and financial management, and entrepreneurship and management. Those interested in pursuing law or medicine choose any major/minor combination but follow a pre-law or pre-med advising track offered through the Office of Pre-Professional Advising. Though their paths may be varied throughout their four years on the Homewood campus, one thing is true of all Hopkins alumni: Graduates of Johns Hopkins are leaders who are distinctly prepared for their futures.", "totalUndergrads": 6331, "totalGradsAndPros": 22559, "pctPell": 17, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 48, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 52}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 0.1, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 1, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 99}, "vHouOff": [["apartment for single students", "100%"]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 13, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 87}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 26, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 74}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered at cooperating institution", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Offered at cooperating institution", "csAvgCost": 29342, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 3526, "nptMed1": 8210, "nptMed2": 9049, "nptHi1": 19177, "nptHi2": 43513}, "netPriceCalculator": "https://npc.collegeboard.org/student/app/jhu", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 15500, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 6937, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 11000, "mdIncDebtMdn": 11082, "hiIncDebtMdn": 16150}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 148, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 21655, "pctIncuredDebt": 40, "vGiBill": 1, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 29, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 140, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "women's center", "placement service", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Student Arts Center, Student Recreation Center, Homewood Museum (historic house museum), Evergreen Museum & Library, Johns Hopkins Archaeological Museum, Baltimore Museum of Art (adjacent to campus).", "vProServAva": ["reading machines", "videotaped classes", "note-taking services", "oral tests", "learning center", "readers", "extended time for tests", "tutors", "early syllabus", "priority registration", "priority seating", "substitution of courses", "typist/scribe", "exams on tape or computer", "other testing accommodations"], "vGuiSpePgm": ["note-taking services", "special transportation", "tape recorders", "special housing", "tutors", "adaptive equipment", "reader services", "braille services", "interpreters for hearing-impaired", "talking books"], "guidnceCmpsAcsblty": "Partly"}, {"primaryKey": "1739", "xwalkId": "147767", "urlName": "northwestern-university", "displayName": "Northwestern University", "shortName": "Northwestern University", "city": "Evanston", "state": "IL", "zip": "60208", "website": "http://www.northwestern.edu", "streetAddress1": "633 Clark Street", "streetAddress2": null, "phone": "(847) 491-3741", "institutionalControl": "private", "privateTuition": ["$60,984", "(2021-22)"], "inStateTuition": "N/A", "outStateTuition": "N/A", "roomAndBoard": ["$18,213", "(2021-22)"], "enrollment": ["8,194", "(fall 2020)"], "latitude": 42.0538, "longitude": -87.6767, "applicationDeadline": "January 3", "usnews_category": "2", "ranks": {"national-universities_overall": "#9", "national-universities_undergraduate-teaching": "#71", "national-universities_best-value": "#18", "national-universities_innovative": "#46", "national-universities_social-mobility": "#256", "engineering-doctorate_overall": "#15", "engineering-doctorate_industrial-manufacturing": "#9", "engineering-doctorate_materials": "#6"}, "topMajors": [], "cSelectClass": "Most selective", "rCAcceptRate": 9, "actSatiLatestDate": "January 3", "gClassSizes": {"vClasses1": 77.7, "vClasses2": 16, "vClasses3": 6.2}, "vStudentFacultyRatio": "6:1", "gradRate4Year": 85, "gStudentGenderDistribution": {"vPctUnderMen": 48, "vPctUnderWomen": 52}, "totalAllStudents": 22072, "association": "NCAA I", "g_financial_aid_statistics": {"pctApplyFinAid": 52.8, "pctNeedFullyMet": 100, "pctRecvAidFt": 46, "pctSelfHelpFt": 32.2, "avgPctNeedMetFt": 100}, "vPrivateTuition": 60984, "wRoomBoard": 18213, "guiAddServIns": "Yes", "schoolStatementText": "Northwestern is committed to providing news and resources for students, faculty and staff throughout the evolving COVID-19 crisis.

Our rigorous yet empathetic academic environment provides a robust mixture of theory and practice, with an emphasis on top-tier research, new knowledge, and practical application. If you are at Northwestern, you are part of an innovative, collaborative, and multidimensional community, delivering an impact that is rare in higher education. Northwestern University offers a wide range of academic choices, extensive undergraduate research opportunities and a beautiful campus located on the shore of Lake Michigan just outside of Chicago. With more than 4,000 courses and 190-plus majors, minors, certificates and concentrations, anyone can plot their own unique Northwestern direction. Northwestern's six undergraduate schools offer choices in arts and sciences, communication, education and social policy, engineering and applied science, journalism and integrated marketing communications, and music. In addition, Northwestern students can choose from more than 150 study abroad programs in 50 countries. Northwestern's 8,200 undergraduates are not limited or confined to a specific academic discipline, but instead are free to explore their options and create their own path. Northwestern's 1,500 full-time faculty members include recipients of the Nobel Prize, Pulitzer Prize, Tony Award, and MacArthur \"genius\" grant, as well as other awards and honors. Northwestern faculty are members of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, Medicine, and Education and the American Academy of Arts & Sciences in addition to other honorary and professional societies. With 77 percent of classes having fewer than 20 students and Northwestern's low 6:1 student-faculty ratio, undergraduate students have numerous opportunities to collaborate with faculty in research, as well as receive career advice and assistance from faculty mentors. Northwestern offers a variety of financial aid options to make a Northwestern education accessible to all. From scholarships to work-study programs, the University works with each individual student and family to provide the necessary resources. Approximately 61percent of undergraduate students receive financial assistance. Northwestern provides generous need-based scholarships and grants, including a No-Loan Scholarship program, which means that qualified students can graduate debt-free. With 95 percent of Northwestern graduates employed or continuing their education full-time within six months of graduation, a Northwestern degree is an extraordinarily valuable asset. Northwestern is a founding member of, and the only private university in, the Big Ten Conference. As a result, Northwestern students get to see some of the best college football, basketball, lacrosse, soccer and other sports. An expanded recreation center and state-of-the-art sailing center on Northwestern's private beach located on campus provide outstanding fitness and recreational facilities for all students. Northwestern is located in Evanston, a quintessential college town, with hundreds of restaurants, cafes and shops a few blocks from the campus. With Chicago next door and free campus shuttle buses going to Northwestern's downtown campus, students can easily take advantage of the music, theatre, museums, sports, and entertainment of a world-class city to enrich their undergraduate experience. In addition, Northwestern's location means that students can participate in internships, field studies and research opportunities at major corporations and nonprofit organizations in Chicago.", "totalUndergrads": 8194, "totalGradsAndPros": 13878, "pctPell": 17, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 48, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 52}, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 60, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 40}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", ""], ["women's dorms", ""], ["men's dorms", ""], ["sorority housing", ""], ["fraternity housing", ""], ["theme housing", ""], ["wellness housing", ""], ["other housing options", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 23, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 77}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 16, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 84}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered at cooperating institution", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered at cooperating institution", "vRotcOffNavy": "Offered on campus", "csAvgCost": 24664, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 1866, "nptMed1": 3995, "nptMed2": 6452, "nptHi1": 16784, "nptHi2": 43465}, "netPriceCalculator": "https://npc.collegeboard.org/student/app/northwestern", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 15500, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 8667, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 12780, "mdIncDebtMdn": 13950, "hiIncDebtMdn": 15320}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 148, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 35219, "pctIncuredDebt": 30, "vGiBill": 1, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 22, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 231, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "women's center", "placement service", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Student patrols", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Block Art Museum, Catalysis Center;

In addition, by maintaining a highly flexible quarter-system calendar, and allowing only faculty to teach its undergraduate courses, Dartmouth assures that students have complete and timely access to all that the institution has to offer. Faculty:  The professors at Dartmouth are among the leaders in their fields, yet they remain fully committed to teaching. Even the most senior professors teach first-year courses. Recipients of more than $162 million in annual research grants and consistently ranked among the most respected teachers in American higher education, Dartmouth professors are true exemplars of the phrase teacher-scholar. Through course-related discussions, research collaborations, and casual conversation, students get to know their professors as instructors, mentors, colleagues, and friends. Undergraduate Students: Dartmouth students come from all 50 states and over 90 countries. The population is divided almost evenly between men and women. Nearly half of the students identify themselves as students of color (38%) or international students (10%). More than half of the students receive some form of need-based financial assistance to cover the cost of their education. Dartmouth disburses over $100 million in need-based aid each year. Prior to Dartmouth, 54% of the students attended public secondary schools and 40% attended private or parochial schools. Once on campus, they take full advantage of the academic resources Dartmouth has to offer, and get involved in the more than 115 officially recognized organizations.", "totalUndergrads": 4170, "totalGradsAndPros": 2122, "pctPell": 15, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 51, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 49}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 0.7, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 45, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 55}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", "69%"], ["sorority housing", "4%"], ["fraternity housing", "7%"], ["apartments for married students", ""], ["apartment for single students", "7%"], ["special housing for disabled students", ""], ["cooperative housing", "1%"], ["theme housing", "12%"]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 29, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 71}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 33, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 67}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Not offered", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered at cooperating institution", "vRotcOffNavy": "Not offered", "csAvgCost": 33574, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 12052, "nptMed1": 4830, "nptMed2": 9044, "nptHi1": 14238, "nptHi2": 51782}, "netPriceCalculator": "https://npc.collegeboard.org/app/dartmouth", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 15000, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 5747, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 7183, "mdIncDebtMdn": 9647, "hiIncDebtMdn": 15000}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 143, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 23850, "pctIncuredDebt": 37, "vGiBill": 1, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 24, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 237, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "women's center", "placement service", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "The Hood Museum (arguably the oldest museum in continuous operation in North America);

Vanderbilt's combination of excellent academics, vibrant campus life, and urban location attracts exceptionally talented students from around the world. From 92 countries and 50 states, Vanderbilt's 6,900 undergraduate students and 5,900 graduate students represent a rich diversity of backgrounds. Among undergraduate students, 8.8 percent are international, 41 percent are minority, and 65 percent receive some type of financial assistance. Vanderbilt offers 68 majors across four undergraduate schools - Blair School of Music, College of Arts and Science, Peabody College of Education and Human Development, and the School of Engineering. Students are encouraged to take advantage of Vanderbilt's interdisciplinary approach, and to take classes and explore interests across schools. With a 7:1 student-faculty ratio, close professor-student connections are made easily. Over 60 percent of undergraduates participate in research and more than 40 percent study abroad. Vanderbilt continues to introduce exciting academic initiatives. Immersion Vanderbilt, the newest addition, calls for each undergraduate to undertake an intensive learning experience in and beyond the classroom with choices in four pathways: civic and professional, creative expression, international, and research. Other recent additions include an undergraduate business minor, developed in collaboration with Vanderbilt's Owen Graduate School of Management; a 230,000 square-foot Science and Engineering Building; and the Wond'ry, Vanderbilt's epicenter for entrepreneurship and innovation. Vanderbilt students maintain a healthy balance while pursuing challenging academics, engaging in an active social life, and participating in myriad extracurricular activities. With 430+ student-led organizations mirroring the diverse array of interests and backgrounds represented at Vanderbilt, campus is always buzzing with activity. Service is important to Vanderbilt students who engage with the local and global communities through a large number of volunteer programs and organizations, such as Alternative Spring Break which was founded at Vanderbilt. Ninety-four percent of undergraduates live on campus at Vanderbilt. All first-year students live on The Martha Rivers Ingram Commons, a collection of ten residence halls. A faculty member lives in each of the houses, facilitating easy and meaningful interactions between students and professors. Housing options for upperclass students include traditional residence halls, suites, themed housing, apartments, and residential colleges. Among the latest additions to campus living are Warren and Moore colleges (opened 2016), and E. Bronson Ingram College (opened 2018). Vanderbilt's location in Midtown Nashville, known as Music City, provides something for everyone: live music in every conceivable genre, and an abundance of restaurants, theaters, and shops, many within walking distance of campus. In addition, Nashville offers volunteer, internship, and job experiences in many industries including health care, publishing, technology, music, finance, and government. One year after graduation, 95 percent of Vanderbilt graduates are employed or attending graduate or professional school. Through Opportunity Vanderbilt, the University makes three important commitments which reflect a dedication to making a Vanderbilt education possible for students from many different economic circumstances: Vanderbilt is need-blind for all U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens; Vanderbilt meets 100 percent of demonstrated need for all admitted students; and Vanderbilt's financial aid packages do not include loans. This initiative does not involve income bands or cutoffs that limit eligibility. Additionally, Vanderbilt offers approximately 250 merit-based scholarships each year.", "totalUndergrads": 7057, "totalGradsAndPros": 6480, "pctPell": 16, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 49, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 51}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 0.1, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 50, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 50}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", ""], ["women's dorms", ""], ["men's dorms", ""], ["special housing for disabled students", ""], ["theme housing", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 27, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 73}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 43, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 57}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered at cooperating institution", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Offered on campus", "csAvgCost": 19432, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 3156, "nptMed1": 6017, "nptMed2": 8086, "nptHi1": 14890, "nptHi2": 36667}, "netPriceCalculator": "http://www.vanderbilt.edu/financialaid/net-price-calculator.php", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 14962, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 6500, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 6000, "mdIncDebtMdn": 9724, "hiIncDebtMdn": 15000}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 143, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 22808, "pctIncuredDebt": 20, "vGiBill": 1, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 13, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 333, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["co-op education", "on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "women's center", "placement service", "day care", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Student patrols", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "The Wond\u2019ry, Vanderbilt\u2019s epicenter for innovation and entrepreneurship;

With five divisions including Architecture, Art, Arts & Sciences, Business, and Engineering, more than 90 areas of study, and more than 1,500 courses, they have the flexibility to explore every subject area of interest. Students may major and minor across divisions and even design their own majors. We offer graduate-level study in all five of those divisions, plus medicine, social work, public health, and law.  Another option for students at WashU is the Beyond Boundaries program, which provides a pathway for students who are interested in solving big societal, intellectual, technological, and scientific challenges that require cross-disciplinary solutions. WashU's offerings outside the classroom are robust with more than 450 organizations and activities. Our students are social-justice minded and motivated to engage in St. Louis and around the world through our Gephardt Institute for Civic and Community Engagement. Students can also take advantage of the research opportunities available throughout every division and at the School of Medicine, working side by side with professors who are leaders in their fields. WashU is selective; our students typically challenge themselves in high school and most graduate in the top 10 percent of their graduating classes. There is no set list of requirements, however, as we look at each applicant with a holistic perspective.

a private Ivy League university, the federal land-grant institution of New York State, and a partner of the State University of New York. It has been described as the first truly American university because of its founders' revolutionary egalitarian and practical vision of higher education, and is dedicated to its land-grant mission of outreach and public service.  Its mission is to discover, preserve, and disseminate knowledge; produce creative work; and promote a culture of broad inquiry throughout and beyond the Cornell community. Cornell also aims, through public service, to enhance the lives and livelihoods of our students, the people of New York, and others around the world.Cornell is committed to excellence, diversity and inclusion, openness, and collaboration. These values are at the center of Cornell as institution. Renowned for its distinctive mix of eminent scholarship, academic rigor and commitment to public service, it attracts more than 20,000 students from every state in the Union and more than 120 countries.

It seeks to fulfill this mission by cultivating a diverse community of learning and discovery that produces leaders across the spectrum of human endeavor. Education has remained at the center of Rice University's mission since the school opened in 1912. Rice combines the advantages of a liberal arts college with the resources and facilities of a premier research university. Our students have unparalleled opportunities to learn from distinguished faculty through classroom interaction, research collaboration and experiential opportunities. Some of the important engineering and science developments include Rice becoming the first university in the nation with a department wholly dedicated to space science; Rice researchers joining Dr. Michael DeBakey and his Baylor College of Medicine team to produce the first artificial heart; and Rice professors Robert Curl, Richard Smalley and British chemist Sir Harold Kroto receiving the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their discovery of buckyballs, which introduced the new field of nanotechnology. In addition to engineering, Rice has highly respected schools of architecture, business, continuing studies, humanities, music, natural sciences and social sciences. Rice also is home to the Baker Institute for Public Policy, a nonpartisan think tank that has brought a distinctive voice to national policy dialogue, and the Kinder Institute for Urban Research, a leading urban think tank that now conducts the longest ongoing study, over 37 years, of any metropolitan area in the U.S. It cultivates leadership and entrepreneurship skills in its students through the Doerr Institute for New Leaders and the Liu Idea Lab for Innovation and Entrepreneurship. It welcomes students from all walks of life, many of them first generation, and supports their success with the Rice Emerging Scholars Program. Rice practices need-blind admission of domestic students, meets 100 percent of all admitted students' demonstrated need, and beginning in fall 2019, domestic students from middle-income families with typical assets will receive grant aid to cover at least full tuition if they earn up to $130,000 a year, and at least half tuition for families earning between $130,001 and $200,000. In addition, students with family incomes below $65,000 will receive grant aid covering not only their full tuition, but also all of their mandatory fees and room and board. Rice is consistently heralded as one of the best values in higher education. Students from all disciplines learn to work together to invent and problem solve in the Oshman Engineering Design Kitchen. Several initiatives, including the Center for Civic Leadership, link Rice students with opportunities for research and service in the country's fourth largest city. Located on a 300-acre wooded campus in the heart of Houston, Rice is surrounded by the Texas Medical Center, the Museum District, Hermann Park, Rice Village and great restaurants, and is a short MetroRail ride, courtesy of free passes, from the theater, symphony, ballet, opera and major league sports. The distinctive residential college system enhances the Rice experience by allowing students to flourish in a community of their peers. Minority students represent more than half of the undergraduate student body, and Rice ranks highly in national student surveys for quality of life and student happiness.

The faculty provide more than 5,000 courses annually, with two-thirds of undergraduate classes having fewer than 30 students. The undergraduate experience can begin with a year-long Freshman Cluster Course, a stimulating team-taught exploration of one of 10 challenging interdisciplinary topics. In addition, 200 Fiat Lux Seminars -- where freshmen have priority enrollment -- are taught by senior faculty in small-group settings of approximately 20 students. Undergraduates also conduct research as early as their freshman year, with more than half of UCLA students graduating with research experience in the humanities, social sciences, and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) disciplines. Outside the classroom, UCLA offers more than 1,000 student organizations providing students with ample opportunity to explore their interests, express their opinions, and have their voices heard. Community service is a cornerstone of undergraduate education at UCLA. Students can connect with opportunities through programs at the Volunteer Center, through more than 220 student groups engaged in community service, or on Volunteer Day, which brings together 8,000 UCLA volunteers annually. UCLA also encourages students to study abroad -- more than 2,000 do so each year -- with more than 392 programs in 43 countries. UCLA is home to leading research centers and institutes, top performing arts programs, an elite Division I athletics program, and the preeminent hospital in the Western United States.

Founded in 1900, the university now stands at the vital intersection of technology and humanity.  CMU attracts the doers and dreamers -- those who dare to take the school motto \"My Heart Is in the Work\" and run with it into the 21st century -- and well beyond. The university welcomes students with bold ideas, relentless energy, diverse backgrounds and a desire to collaborate across disciplines. At CMU, the drive to find a better way fuels everything we do.  The fabric of the community interweaves nearly 7,000 undergrads among a 14,500+ total student population from 117 countries, and nearly 1,500 faculty members representing 52 countries. The university is home to quirky traditions like a kilt-wearing bagpipe band, the most painted fence in the world and a student-run annual spring carnival.CMU has seven schools and colleges: the College of Engineering, the College of Fine Arts, the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, the Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy, the Mellon College of Science, the School of Computer Science and the Tepper School of Business.  The university earns high marks in science, technology, business, public policy, the humanities and the arts. Carnegie Mellon is frequently ranked #1 for its School of Computer Science and excels in a wide range of programs such as Time-Based New Media, Information & Technology Management and Artificial Intelligence.CMU has produced 20 Nobel laureates, 26 members of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, 60 members of the National Academy of Engineering, 20 members of the National Academy of Sciences, 13 Turing Award recipients, 14 Guggenheim fellows, two MacArthur Foundation fellows, one National Book Award winner, two National Medal of Science winners and six National Medal of Technology and Innovation winners. What's more, current and former faculty and alumni have won 10 Academy Awards, more than 130 Emmy Awards and 50 Tony Awards. From Broadway to Silicon Valley, CMU has engaged with practitioners and partners in the public and private sectors. The university has more than 575 corporate partners, including Google, Apple and Uber. Its entrepreneurial culture has helped to create more than 340 startups in the past 10 years, helping to fuel Pittsburgh's renaissance.  Carnegie Mellon's main campus sits on 152 acres in Oakland, a historic neighborhood just 3.6 miles east of downtown Pittsburgh. No longer a steel town, Pittsburgh is beautiful, affordable and livable -- especially for students -- with thriving arts, culture, music, food, sports and outdoor scenes. No vehicle is required -- students can easily get around on foot or by bike, bus or ride sharing.  CMU's locations include Silicon Valley, Africa, Australia and Qatar as well as programs in New York, Washington, D.C., Asia, Europe and Latin America. More than 100,000 alumni representing 144 countries help foster the university's global perspective.

leading private research university. Its University Park campus is part of the city's Downtown Arts and Education Corridor and is home to the USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and many professional schools. The Health Sciences campus, northeast of downtown Los Angeles, is the location of the Keck School of Medicine of USC, the School of Pharmacy and three major teaching hospitals. USC's distinguished faculty of 4,000 innovative scholars, researchers, teachers and mentors includes five Nobel laureates, and dozens of recipients of prestigious national honors including the MacArthur \"Genius\" Award, Guggenheim Award, the National Medal of the Arts, the National Humanities Medal, the National Medal of Science, the National Medal of Technology and Innovation, and Pulitzer Prize. For example, USC Dornsife Professor Natalia Molina was named a 2020 MacArthur Fellow in recognition of her examinations of race, citizenship and belonging among immigrant groups in the United States, Associate Professor Viet Thanh Nguyen was awarded the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. USC's Viterbi School of Engineering counts among its alumni Neil Armstrong, first human on the moon; A.C. Mike Markkula, co-founder of Apple; and Wanda Austin, former CEO of the Aerospace Corporation. The university's student body (for the 2020-2021 academic year) consists of 19,500 undergraduates and 26,500 graduate and professional students. The number of students who are the first in their families to attend USC has been growing steadily for five years -- 22 percent of the incoming class are first-generation college students, and 30 percent of the Class of 2024 are students of color. With one of the most abundant financial aid pools in the country, USC provides more than $450 million in scholarships and aid.  The number of graduate students exceeds the number of undergraduates at USC, with students enrolled in such programs as the highly ranked Marshall School of Business, Rossier School of Education, Andrew and Erna Viterbi School of Engineering, Gould School of Law, Keck School of Medicine and School of Social Work. USC is also well known for its Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and its highly esteemed School of Cinematic Arts, which has graduated students such as directors Judd Apatow and George Lucas. Graduates of USC's Thornton School of Music attain positions with major orchestras, ensembles, recording studios and music industry firms and perform on stages and in studios around the world. The Trojan Marching Band has performed at the Academy Awards, the Hollywood Bowl, the Rose Parade, and in numerous film and television productions. In 1979, the band recorded the title track for the album Tusk with the rock group Fleetwood Mac.   USC's newest professional school is the USC Iovine and Young Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation. Art and design, business, technology and communications converge at the academy, where students bring a cross-disciplinary approach to problem solving.  USC's highly successful college preparation program, Neighborhood Academic Initiative, has nearly 1,000 students in South and East Los Angeles neighborhoods on the path to a university education. More than a thousand military veterans are enrolled at USC, which offers a military social work track through the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work. The Center for Innovation and Research on Veterans and Military Families guides behavioral health practitioners, informs policymakers and builds community networks to support veterans and military families.  USC's retention and six-year graduation rates exceed 90%. Student support services include the First Generation Plus Student Success Center, a resource hub for current first-generation, undocumented, transfer, and former foster youth students as they navigate campus.", "totalUndergrads": 19606, "totalGradsAndPros": 26501, "pctPell": 20, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 48, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 52}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 0.6, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 98, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 2}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", "34%"], ["sorority housing", ""], ["fraternity housing", ""], ["apartments for married students", "5%"], ["apartment for single students", "61%"], ["special housing for disabled students", ""], ["special housing for international students", ""], ["cooperative housing", ""], ["theme housing", ""], ["wellness housing", ""], ["other housing options", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 11, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 89}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 14, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 86}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Offered on campus", "csAvgCost": 29528, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 14668, "nptMed1": 16252, "nptMed2": 20050, "nptHi1": 30858, "nptHi2": 52271}, "netPriceCalculator": "http://www.usc.edu/npc", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 19459, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 12000, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 18250, "mdIncDebtMdn": 18500, "hiIncDebtMdn": 17250}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 186, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 26850, "pctIncuredDebt": 33, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 26, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 226, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["co-op education", "on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "placement service", "day care", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Student patrols", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Fisher Museum of Art, Hancock Museum, architecture galleries, Gamble & Freeman Houses;

Students are asked to understand global culture and to see the importance of context beyond any singular discipline. Tufts believes in using intellect to impact the world and in understanding how the world impacts our intellectual pursuits. It is not uncommon to find a computer scientist partnering with faculty in mechanical engineering and drama to program robots that can tell a good story or a religion major studying to become a doctor who understands of how faith, ethics, and health are linked. Tufts' cross-disciplinary strength is possible because of its combination of intimate size and world-class research.

We are The Gator Nation, a diverse community dedicated to excellence in education and research and shaping a better future for Florida, the nation, and the world. Our mission is to enable our students to lead and influence the next generation and beyond for economic, cultural, and societal benefit.Established in 1853, today the university enrolls nearly 58,000 students on campus and in our highly ranked undergraduate online programs, employs more than 5,400 full-time faculty in instruction, research, and public service, and contributes more than $16 billion to the state's economy. UF offers nearly 100 undergraduate degree programs and more than 200 graduate degree programs. The University of Florida integrates 16 colleges on a single campus -- agriculture, the arts, business, dentistry, design and construction, education, engineering, health and human performance, journalism and communication, law, liberal arts and sciences, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, public health, and health professions, and veterinary medicine.The University of Florida is a member of the Association of American Universities, which includes the top 66 public and private research universities in North America. Forty-five faculty have been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, the Institute of Medicine, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Research expenditures grew to $942 million in FY2020. A leader in tech transfer, the university was also named the world's No. 1 incubator for biotech startups. UF consistently ranks among the nation's leading universities, including U.S. News & World Report \"Top Public Universities\".The main campus is located on 2,000 acres in north central Florida, with more than 1,000 buildings. One of the nation's largest institutions, the University of Florida offers students a broad range of academic opportunities with ready access to faculty. The student-faculty ratio is 1:17. UF is among public universities with the highest graduation rates -- 67% of freshmen graduate in 4 years and 89% graduate in 6 years.UF also offers one of the most affordable undergraduate degrees, with the lowest tuition of any AAU public or private institution. About 64% of all undergraduate students who start at UF graduate with no student loan debt and UF offers a variety of grants for those students with financial need. Students come from 145 countries and all 50 states, plus the District of Columbia. UF is among the top universities that lead both African American and Latinx in Ph.D.'s in STEM fields.Preparing scholars who will make a difference in the world, UF is the first higher education institution in the country to acquire the new NVIDIA DGX A 100 - the world's most advanced Artificial Intelligence supercomputer. This bold initiative to become a national leader in the application of Artificial Intelligence (Al) includes a commitment to hiring 100 faculty members specifically focused on Al and a plan to add Al curriculum across many majors, creating a next-generation workforce and positioning graduates as leaders in a technological revolution. UF continues to expand and renew its academic and athletic facilities. The Herbert Wertheim Laboratory for Engineering Excellence (Nuclear Science Building) recently added 87,000 square feet of state-of-the-art, high-technology instruction, and research lab space. Historic Norman Hall, home to the College of Education, underwent complete renovations in 2020. Additionally, UF broke ground on the Malachowsky Hall for Data Science & Information Technology, a 263,000-square-foot interdisciplinary hub to be completed by 2023.Since our founding over 160 years ago, we continually push the boundaries of knowledge forward.

Carolina is best known for having one of the strongest and most diverse student bodies in the nation - a community of students from every state and more than 100 countries. Carolina's most recently admitted class includes students who will be the first in their families to graduate from college (20 percent of the class), are high school valedictorians or salutatorians (12 percent of the class), are committed to serving their communities (91 percent volunteered during high school), and are eager to learn and grow (95 percent want to get better at leading, serving, and working with people from different backgrounds). Carolina offers academic opportunities that prepare students to empower themselves and their communities; over the past five classes, an average of 93 percent of Carolina graduates go on to earn jobs or enter graduate school within six months of graduating. Admission to Carolina is competitive, but we are dedicated to making it fair and considerate. We don't use formulas or cutoffs; instead, we read each application and get to know the student as an individual. Students travel many different roads to Carolina, and we celebrate the variety of interests, backgrounds, and aspirations they bring. At the same time, we seek excellence. We focus on both performance and potential, getting to know each student's achievements within the context of their environment. We actively seek excellence in arts, athletics, leadership, service, citizenship, and character. This list isn't exhaustive or prescriptive. When we read an application, we're interested in what a student has done, what they care about, and the difference they will make as a member of Carolina's community. Just by applying for admission, students are additionally considered for a range of special opportunities including scholarships, Honors Carolina, guaranteed enrollment programs, fellowships, and research opportunities. We're committed to ensuring that every student who earns a place at Carolina can afford to attend, and our financial aid program meets full need and enables qualified low-income students to graduate debt-free through the Carolina Covenant.", "totalUndergrads": 19399, "totalGradsAndPros": 10699, "pctPell": 23, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 40, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 60}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 0.5, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 23, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 77}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", "69%"], ["women's dorms", "5%"], ["men's dorms", "1%"], ["sorority housing", "3%"], ["fraternity housing", "5%"], ["apartments for married students", "4%"], ["apartment for single students", "9%"], ["special housing for disabled students", "1%"], ["special housing for international students", "3%"], ["theme housing", ""], ["wellness housing", ""], ["other housing options", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 15, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 85}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 17, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 83}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Offered on campus", "csAvgCost": 12352, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 4026, "nptMed1": 6063, "nptMed2": 11060, "nptHi1": 18354, "nptHi2": 22235}, "netPriceCalculator": "https://npc.collegeboard.org/student/app/unc", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 15400, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 8000, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 9095, "mdIncDebtMdn": 13832, "hiIncDebtMdn": 15957}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 147, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 20563, "pctIncuredDebt": 36, "vGiBill": 2, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 25, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 729, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "women's center", "placement service", "day care", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Ackland Art Museum, American Indian Center (AIC), Be A Maker Space (BeAM), Kenan-Flagler Business Capital Markets Lab, Carolina Basketball Museum, Institute of Latin American Studies, Ida B.

With 5,200 undergraduates, the University provides the highly personalized attention characteristic of America's most selective private institutions coupled with the breadth and depth of a large research institution. Founded in 1834, Wake Forest is committed to personal education, inquiry and exploration, and service. The Graduate School for Arts and Sciences, along with professional schools in law, medicine, business and divinity, enrich the intellectual environment and provide robust resources to undergraduates, as do extensive programs in international studies, entrepreneurship and undergraduate research. The University further distinguishes itself through its beautiful residential campus, sophisticated computing and networking technology, and Atlantic Coast Conference athletic programs. The vibrant campus offers students opportunities to get involved, explore ideas, and take initiative to create programs and events of their own. Wake Forest professors embody the teacher-scholar ideal, which links exceptional teaching with fundamental research and discovery. This results in meaningful research opportunities for students and classroom experiences with professors who are relevant in their fields. Undergraduate classes are taught by full-time faculty, not graduate assistants. Wake Forest's motto, Pro Humanitate (for humanity), is at the heart of the University's identity and reflects a dedication to making a difference in the world. Volunteerism is a priority among Wake Forest students, who serve regularly at local agencies or travel around the country and the world to participate in various projects.  Wake Forest is home to the Center for Nanotechnology and Molecular Materials, which works closely with industry leaders to transfer its groundbreaking work in nanotechnology to practical applications in the areas of medicine, manufacturing and national defense. Wake Downtown, located in downtown Winston-Salem, is home to the University's engineering and biomedical science programs. The Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine is an international leader in the translation of scientific discovery into clinical therapies. Wake Forest is a national leader in rethinking the college to career experience and is at the forefront of transforming the traditional concept of career services into a holistic, four-year approach to personal and career development. The University has become a national model for creating a college-to-career community designed to help students prepare to lead lives that matter.", "totalUndergrads": 5441, "totalGradsAndPros": 3348,

Among America's top tier research universities, Rochester stands apart with its close integration of academic and co-curricular life, nearly 90% residential for four years, and sustained commitment to students learning from tenure-track faculty. Rochester students customize their academic experience from the outset. With no general education requirements, every student in every class wants to be there and is highly engaged. Right away, entering students can delve into specific academic areas, while other Exploratory students who haven't chosen a major begin an intellectual adventure with the help of advisors and professors. Many students explore interdisciplinary studies or carry multiple majors. Learning here takes place on a personal scale. Rochester offers smaller classes and meaningful collaborations with faculty, with all the amenities of a top research university -- a rare combination in higher education. Students undertake research projects, internships, and shadowing experiences in Rochester's nationally ranked schools of engineering, medicine, nursing, music, education, and business. Rochester faculty are world-renowned experts who attract more than $438 Million in research funding annually and recognize that tomorrow's breakthroughs in knowledge and creativity will occur by collaborating across academic disciplines. The university is educating deliberately global citizens. Just over one-quarter of undergraduates are international, bringing global perspectives from 125 countries to campus. Through partnerships, research, teaching, and advocacy, students and faculty address the world's biggest challenges, and pursue internships, fellowships, networks, and careers all around the world. Students transform classroom ideas into new intellectual, social, cultural, and business enterprises at home and beyond. Students live up to Rochester's motto, 'Meliora' (ever better), preparing to lead the future of industry, education, and culture. Navigating through world-renowned facilities and resources, a day in the life of two Rochester students, or any two days in the life of a single student, are never the same. There are 280 student organizations offering a tremendous variety. The Division III athletics program supports 23 competitive varsity teams, including a perennially top-ranked men's squash team, as well as club and intramural sports. Nearby downtown Rochester is the center of a thriving, historic region with a strong entrepreneurial business community. Within 10 minutes of campus are abundant dining, shopping, world-class museums, year-round recreation and performing arts options, including the university's renowned Eastman School of Music and Memorial Art Gallery, the George Eastman international museum of photography, the Strong Museum of Play, and the Rochester Museum and Science Center. Rochester offers academic merit scholarships and meets 100% of demonstrated need for admitted students. Rochester's holistic test-optional admissions process assesses academic excellence but also asks: What are your values? How have you made yourself and your community better? How will you make the world better?", "totalUndergrads": 6521, "totalGradsAndPros": 5220, "pctPell": 16, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 49, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 51}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 0.3, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 57, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 43}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", ""], ["women's dorms", ""], ["men's dorms", ""], ["sorority housing", ""], ["fraternity housing", ""], ["apartments for married students", ""], ["apartment for single students", ""], ["theme housing", ""], ["other housing options", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 15, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 85}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 12, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 88}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered at cooperating institution", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered at cooperating institution", "vRotcOffNavy": "Offered on campus", "csAvgCost": 29522, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 15324, "nptMed1": 14508, "nptMed2": 23659, "nptHi1": 29342, "nptHi2": 44732}, "netPriceCalculator": "https://enrollment.rochester.edu/financial-aid/net-price-calculator/", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 19000, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 9000, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 18750, "mdIncDebtMdn": 19000, "hiIncDebtMdn": 19000}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 181, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 29791, "pctIncuredDebt": 52, "vGiBill": 1, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 44, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 707, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["co-op education", "on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "women's center", "placement service", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Student patrols", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Eastman School of Music; Memorial Art Gallery, 18th century Italian Baroque organ; Laboratory for Laser Energetics, OMEGA 60 laser and OMEGA EP laser system; C.

Achievements in the sciences, arts, humanities, medicine, and management have garnered top 50 national rankings for more than 40 academic programs. Three UCI researchers have won Nobel Prizes--two in chemistry and one in physics. We were the youngest campus ever to be welcomed into the prestigious Association of American Universities. The New York Times, in its College Access Index, ranked UCI as number one in the nation for economic diversity in its student body, citing us as \"doing the most for the American dream.\" And you will be especially glad to hear that Money magazine named UCI the top university for beach lovers. These are some of the reasons why UCI attracted more than 116,000 undergraduate applications in 2017, the third largest number of applications in the entire nation, for only 8,300 spots. Our graduate programs are also extremely competitive. You are on this campus because we know you have what it takes to succeed at the highest level.UCI reaches beyond the classroom and laboratory to help solve societal issues and support human development. We are a hub for stem cell research, a trailblazer in understanding global warming, and a leader in the fight against breast cancer. Our nationally ranked medical center in Orange serves as Orange County's only Level I trauma center, and our state-of-the-art UC Irvine Douglas Hospital has been ranked among the country's top 50 hospitals for more than 10 years, providing outstanding care for the region's citizens. We ranked fourth in the University Global Health Impact Report Card, which evaluates top U.S. and Canadian research universities on their contributions to urgent global health research and access to treatment worldwide. Our law school, the state's first public law school to open in more than 40 years, graduated its first class in 2012. In July 2012, the Regents established the UC Irvine School of Education from the existing Department of Education in recognition of its national academic profile. Our newest school, the Sue and Bill Gross School of Nursing, was established in January 2017.A major intellectual and cultural center, UCI offers numerous public activities and events. The Claire Trevor School of the Arts and the School of Humanities produce engaging and entertaining cultural programs, including the award-winning New Swan Theater, our summertime outdoor Shakespeare Festival. UCI's Anteater athletes have won more than two dozen national championships.We are also national leaders in research and practice relating to sustainability and environmental protection. UCI is the most energy-efficient campus in California, with among the most LEED Platinum and Gold certified buildings in the U.S. We are consistently among the top 10 \"Coolest Schools\" in Sierra magazine's annual ranking of the nation's greenest universities.UCI is benefiting the community and the world in countless ways through its scholarly, scientific, creative, and economic contributions.

world-class agricultural and veterinary programs, but we're so much more than that. With more than 100 undergraduate majors and 90 graduate programs, we're also the most comprehensive school in the University of California system. UC Davis is an affordable choice among elite universities. Over half of our students graduate without student loan debt. We attract students and faculty from across the globe. Walk around campus or the city and you might hear people speaking French, Farsi, Mandarin and so many other languages. No matter what you study, you'll receive an extraordinary education.  People who come to UC Davis want to make the world a better place. We're on the frontlines of critical issues like managing climate change, bettering the health of humans and animals, and seeking a more sustainable future. When COVID-19 struck, UC Davis led the way not only in conducting critical research and trials, but also in safeguarding our students, staff and the whole Davis community. Located in the heart of California just west of Sacramento, Davis is California's College Town. Our icon isn't a bell tower, or an ivory tower, but a water tower. It's a place of big ideas and innovation in a friendly, student-centered environment. Our region is thriving with technological development and entrepreneurship. Opportunity is everywhere. UC Davis is an active and lively place where biking and bussing are the preferred modes of transportation.

Its impetus was a powerful idea: the only non-sectarian institution founded by the Jewish community, Brandeis would be open to all, embracing the pluralism of American society, and with a commitment to making a positive impact on the world.  Powerfully focused on academic rigor and intensity, it almost immediately equaled and exceeded older institutions, prizing intellectual inquiry and relishing discussion and debate. In its thirteenth year, Brandeis earned Phi Beta Kappa recognition, the youngest institution ever to do so. Brandeis offers a distinctive model: the personal attention and flexibility of a liberal arts college with the depth and opportunity of a research institution. Brandeis enrolls 3,600 undergraduate students, drawn from all parts of the nation and the world and from diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. A faculty of tremendous scholarly distinction is equally committed to education - every faculty member teaches.  A small student-faculty ratio preserves close connections between teachers and students. You will be educated in the classroom, but also in the field, the studio, and the laboratory, both locally and globally, and we integrate these various modes of experiential education and discovery with classroom learning. Brandeis is academically intense: most undergraduates complete two majors or combine a major with one or more minors, and a number pursue one of our 13 combined Bachelor-Masters degree programs. Students average an amazing three internships before graduation.Brandeis students also sustain a vibrant co-curricular life.  From two student newspapers, a radio and television station, 19 varsity sports, and over 200 other clubs and organizations, you will have unrivaled opportunity for campus leadership.  Student activities, from our famous Chums coffee house to over 350 performing arts events each year, combine with school-wide traditions to keep campus life busy every evening and weekend.  Students also enjoy our location in the Boston area, with a commuter rail stop right on campus and shuttle services offering easy access to Americas greatest college town.  Following our commitment to social justice, Brandeis largest student group focuses on community service, and students logged over 50,000 hours of service in the past year.", "totalUndergrads": 3493, "totalGradsAndPros": 1947, "pctPell": 16, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 40, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 60}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 0, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 52, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 48}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", ""], ["apartment for single students", ""], ["special housing for disabled students", ""], ["theme housing", ""], ["other housing options", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 0, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 100}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 0, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 100}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered at cooperating institution", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered at cooperating institution", "vRotcOffNavy": "Not offered", "csAvgCost": 31165, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 13567, "nptMed1": 16074, "nptMed2": 20122, "nptHi1": 29713, "nptHi2": 49781}, "netPriceCalculator": "http://www.brandeis.edu/sfs/finaid/calculator.html", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 26150, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 12000, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 21500, "mdIncDebtMdn": 25407, "hiIncDebtMdn": 23375}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 249, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 31106, "pctIncuredDebt": 45, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 39, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 235, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "women's center", "placement service", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "The Rose Art Museum at Brandeis is among the premier university museums of modern and contemporary art in the country.

Undergraduates make up three-quarters of the student population. Roughly 73 percent of the undergraduate students come from the 102 counties of Illinois, with the rest traveling to Illinois from all 50 states and more than 100 nations. All are highly qualified and choose between 150 undergraduate programs of study. The middle 50 percent of freshmen at Illinois score between 26 and 30 on the ACT, and these same students ranked between the 84th and 96th percentile in their high school graduating classes. Undergraduate students often travel around the globe through one of the top ten study abroad programs among major research institutions in the United States.Faculty members also are well connected internationally, collaborating with other top scholars from around the world and across disciplines. They are world-renowned scholars who have been recognized with such top awards as Nobel Prizes, Pulitzer Prizes, Guggenheim Fellowships, Tony Awards, MacArthur \"genius\" awards, and memberships in the nations elite academies of arts and sciences. Of twelve Nobel laureates who have served on the faculty, two were honored for work undertaken at this University. Illinois became only the third American public university, and the eleventh institution in the world, ever to have two Nobel Prizes (in different fields) awarded to members of its faculty in the same year. Urbana campus alumni are similarly recognized. Eleven University alumni have won Nobel Prizes.Campus resources include the worlds largest public university library, with millions of items circulated and hundreds of thousands of reference questions answered each year. Outstanding centers for performance and training in the arts include one of the nations best performing arts facilities, the Krannert Center. World-class research facilities in Urbana include the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, Beckman Institute, Institute for Genomic Biology and Siebel Center for Computer Science.Of course, many people across the nation know Urbana-Champaign as the home of nine mens and 10 womens Big Ten sports teams. The campus Division of Intercollegiate Athletics is know for its integrity and its emphasis on scholarship among its athletes. Mens basketball and football are high profile sports, but Illinois also has won recent national and conference champions in such programs as gymnastics, tennis, and wrestling.", "totalUndergrads":

launching our nation's great tradition of world-class public education. What began as a commitment to inspire the next generation grows stronger today through global research, hands-on experiential learning and extensive outreach. A top 20 best value in public higher education, the University of Georgia tackles some of the world's grand challenges -- from combating infectious diseases and securing the world's food supply to advancing economic growth and analyzing the environment. As Georgia's flagship institution, the university is recognized for its commitment to student excellence, particularly through an emphasis on rigorous learning experiences both inside and outside the classroom, hands-on research, and leadership opportunities. The University of Georgia is one of the largest universities to require all students to participate in experiential learning opportunities and provides various options for each student. It also launched the Double Dawgs program, which enables students to save time and money by earning an undergraduate and graduate degree in five years or less. These experiences contribute to the university's exceptional retention, graduation and career-placement rates. The Morehead Honors College is one of the most highly regarded honors programs in the country, and the University of Georgia has been one of the nation's top three producers of Rhodes Scholars among public universities over the past two decades.  Scholars at the University of Georgia are committed to improving the quality of life for all and lead discovery in pivotal fields such as vaccine development, biomedical research, cybersecurity, and plant sciences. One of the nation's top universities for technology commercialization, UGA has been a Top 5 university for total products reaching the market for the past seven years, with more than 850 products to date derived from university research. The University of Georgia has been in the Top 20 public universities in overall licensing revenue for 16 consecutive years, ranking No. 9 among public universities and No. 21 overall in 2019. The university is developing its Innovation District, a comprehensive ecosystem of places, programs, and people all working together to foster innovation, entrepreneurship, and experiential learning. With its comprehensive reach, the university's 18 colleges and schools enroll 39,000 students and have produced 340,000 alumni living worldwide. The University of Georgia's initiatives extend globally while touching every corner of the state, realizing the university's land-grant and sea-grant missions. The university's eight Public Service and Outreach units, which are among the strongest in the nation, help create jobs, develop leaders and address critical challenges. Research, outreach and extension serve as major drivers of economic and workforce development and spark successful partnerships that create new businesses and train the workforce of tomorrow. The university's threefold teaching, research and service mission spans the globe with campuses in five Georgia locations, Washington, D.C., England, and Italy, as well as partnerships in more than 50 countries on six continents.Located in the Classic City of Athens, approximately an hour northeast of Atlanta, the university thrives in a community that promotes the benefits of a culture-rich college town with a strong economic center. The campus is home to more than 700 registered student and service organizations. The university's athletic programs are among the most successful in NCAA Division I, and the 21 varsity athletic teams compete as Georgia Bulldogs, with \"Uga\" consistently ranking as one of the nation's most recognized mascots.

Lehigh prepares students within a rigorous academic environment that blends learning inside and outside the classroom and promotes creativity, innovation and interaction.

Faculty work closely with students across disciplines and translate research and theory into practice. The close, mentoring relationships between students and faculty members across each of our five colleges provide all students with an opportunity to learn in a warm and collaborative atmosphere. Students are given the flexibility to explore academic areas outside their major field of study, where they learn how new knowledge comes at the intersection of ideas. Academic life at Lehigh extends well beyond the classroom, and students are engaged in educational pursuits in their local community and the world at large. Over 600 international learning opportunities and internships are available, including the fully-funded, individually designed lacocca lnternational lnternships and our unique NGO partnership with the United Nations. The connection to the West Coast is strong with the Lehigh@NasdaqCenter and Lehigh Western Regional office, both developed to extend educational opportunities for Lehigh students and faculty by building curricular and research partnerships with dynamic enterprises in western cities. A highly active campus life offers students countless opportunities through more than 150 clubs and organizations, 25 Division I varsity sports, intramural and club programs and a vibrant arts scene. Lehigh's picturesque campus spans 2,355 acres, making it one of the largest private campuses in the country. More than 5,000 students call this hillside university home within our four distinguished undergraduate colleges: Arts & Sciences, Business, Engineering, and Health. Students go on to high levels of success in their chosen careers, with 95 percent of the class employed or in graduate school six months after graduation.

Here, the real world and the classroom are integrated through experiential learning; where academics are brought to life. Northeastern provides its students with the guidance and support to study, work, research and serve on all seven continents and in any field of study--all while charting a personalized path to the future.At the heart of a Northeastern education are award-winning faculty mentors, a rigorous and innovative curriculum, and undergraduate research and global experiences that challenge and transform. Northeastern's innovative programs encompass over 220+, 130 combined majors, along with a variety of concentrations, honors, pre-professional, and study-abroad programs. Over half of Northeastern students have more than just a major--either a double major, a major and a minor, a combined major, or another combination.Personalized, guided, and supported flexibility enables students to choose a path with 6- 18 months immersed in meaningful,  real-world experience, while creating a strong professional network and giving students confidence--as well as a significant edge in the job market. These professional co-op experiences allow students to bring a more informed perspective to the classroom and to learn what career is a good fit--and what careers are not--all before graduating. Northeastern partners with nearly 3,100 co-op employers around the globe, including some of the world's largest and most reputable companies. Over half of students are offered full-time jobs from previous co-op employers.Research at Northeastern happens across all disciplines and is available to students as early as freshman year. Students can work in a faculty lab, complete a research coop, or do an independent project and present their findings at a campus research expo. With over $160 million in external funding for research and a wealth of student organizations geared toward student research, the opportunities are endless.As students continue to explore their academic and professional goals, Northeastern also encourage them to explore the world around them through a global experience. Whether it is through traditional study abroad, a global research project or co-op, or a Dialogue of Civilizations (a 4-5 week global program that focuses on critical current issues)--Northeastern offers a wealth of experiences to take advantage of.Participation in service learning--whether it's in Boston, across the country, or around the world--is a core piece of what makes Northeastern unique. With over 2.23 million hours of service completed by students since 2006, service learning can be incorporated into a student's academic plan through coursework, co-ops, or programs such as alternative spring break.", "totalUndergrads": 15156, "totalGradsAndPros": 7749, "pctPell": 13, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 49, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 51}, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 33, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 67}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", ""], ["apartment for single students", ""], ["theme housing", ""], ["wellness housing", ""], ["other housing options", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 10, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 90}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 18, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 82}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered at cooperating institution", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Offered at cooperating institution", "csAvgCost": 31093, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 10239, "nptMed1": 12823, "nptMed2": 17692, "nptHi1": 25744, "nptHi2": 43383}, "netPriceCalculator": "https://npc.collegeboard.org/student/app/northeastern", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 24855, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 13666, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 23000, "mdIncDebtMdn": 23005, "hiIncDebtMdn": 22882}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 237, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 33570, "pctIncuredDebt": 48, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 33, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 73, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["co-op education", "on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "day care", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Student patrols", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "John D.

To this day, Villanova's Augustinian Catholic intellectual tradition is the cornerstone of an academic community in which students learn to think critically, act compassionately and succeed while serving others. Villanova prepares students to become ethical leaders who create positive change everywhere life takes them. The strength of the Villanova experience comes in part from the University's welcoming community. All members are bonded together by a shared responsibility to uphold the ideals of Saint Augustine and let the principles of truth, unity and love guide their lives. The Villanova community helps students grow intellectually, professionally and spiritually, and challenges them to reach their full potential. The University's rigorous academic experience, rooted in the liberal arts, forms an environment in which students and professors are partners in learning. The Villanova community is dedicated to providing a personalized experience that fosters every student's intellectual and spiritual well-being. As part of their education, students are encouraged to enrich their own lives by working for those in need. Through academic and service programs, students use their knowledge, skills and compassion to better the world around them. There are 11,000 undergraduate, graduate and law students in the University's six colleges--the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, the Villanova School of Business, the College of Engineering, the M. Louise Fitzpatrick College of Nursing, the College of Professional Studies and the Villanova University Charles Widger School of Law. These colleges are the setting for an experience that develops both the heart and the mind, and creates the atmosphere where students are called to ignite change.

You may be aware of our successful athletics programs, but in the past decade more than 250 students have won the most competitive national academic and leadership awards, including three Rhodes Scholarships in recent years.  Our students are highly engaged in leadership, community service, entrepreneurship, study abroad, undergraduate research, or any of 700 student organizations. Florida State is a destination campus, and it shows. Most of our students come from great distances to the state capital for the opportunity to join our community. The campus is student centered as evidenced by a 4-year graduation rate that is the highest in Florida and among the nation's top 10. When you combine our student success with our relatively low costs, you see why we often are rated as one of the top educational values in the United States.Our 17 colleges offer more than 340 undergraduate, graduate and professional degrees and cover a broad array of disciplines critical to society today. With many rated among the country's best, we stand firmly among the nation's top public universities, reflected in a meteoric rise in national rankings. Led by our distinguished faculty, which has included six Nobel laureates and numerous eminent scholars in many areas of the arts and sciences, our academic programs continue to receive major recognition for their overall strength. \tOur excellence also shines beyond traditional academic settings. In 2019, FSU became the first public research university in America to require experiential learning, or \"learning by doing.\" Our international programs are unparalleled with more than 60 programs in over 20 locations. In the area of athletics, our student-athletes continue to perform at championship levels, both on and off the field. Our students supplement their academic pursuits each year with hundreds of thousands of hours of community service outside of the classroom. In immeasurable ways, this University reaches out to our community, region, state, and nation. This level of service has been recognized by the Carnegie Foundation, which has selected Florida State University for inclusion in its prestigious Community Engagement classification.Our Honors Programs, Office of National Fellowships, Office of Undergraduate Research, and Student Veterans Center are just a few of the programs here on campus that show our strong commitment to help our more than 30,000 undergraduates reach their highest academic goals. To provide further support for student success, the University's Garnet and Gold Scholar Society program awards undergraduates a credential affirming their leadership, professional, citizenship, and/or research skills while building collaborative relationships in the academic, local, or global community.With a dedicated faculty and staff, a commitment to strong undergraduate and graduate programs that prepare students for the marketplace, and a research agenda that contributes to our world economy and quality of life, Florida State University is a leader in higher education.

Since its founding in 1824, Rensselaer has maintained its reputation for providing a transformative education of undisputed intellectual rigor based on innovation in the laboratory, classroom, and studio. The Institute's motto is: \"Why not change the world?\" Rensselaer offers more than 145 programs at the bachelor's, master's, and doctoral levels from five schools: Engineering; Science; Architecture; Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences; and the Lally School of Management; as well as an interdisciplinary degree in Information Technology and Web Science. Students are encouraged to work in interdisciplinary programs that allow them to combine scholarly work from several departments. The Institute provides engaging, interactive learning environments and campus-wide opportunities for leadership, collaboration, and creativity. Driven by talented and forward-thinking faculty, Rensselaer has expanded its research enterprise by focusing on five signature research areas: biotechnology and the life sciences; energy, environment, and smart systems; computational science and engineering; nanotechnology and advanced materials; and media, arts, science, and technology. The Institute is well-known for its success in the transfer of technology from the laboratory to the marketplace so that new discoveries and inventions benefit human life, protect the environment, and strengthen economic development. Rensselaer is anchored by two vibrant roots. One root, written into the school's founding documents, is \"...the application of science to the common purposes of life.\" Rensselaer graduates constructed the canals, roads, bridges, skyscrapers, and basic infrastructure of America, which helped to form the basis for 20th-century society. The second root, also built into the school's origin, is the employment of novel educational strategies. In the earliest days, students taught what they learned to each other, and performed scientific experiments instead of watching faculty conduct them. Today's pedagogical innovations include such groundbreaking prototypes as the intelligent immersive classroom and a \"data dexterity\" requirement for all students. Rensselaer is led by the Honorable Shirley Ann Jackson and guided by The Rensselaer Plan 2024, under which the Institute has made major investments in people, programs, platforms, and partnerships that have transformed Rensselaer into a top-tier technological research university with global reach and global impact. The plan addresses three critical areas: student life, innovative pedagogy, and research to solve global challenges. Through CLASS (Clustered Learning, Advocacy, and Support for Students), the Institute provides faculty, staff, and peer support, as well as co-curricular opportunities for students throughout their undergraduate years. A new program called The Arch has been launched in which students spend a summer semester on campus and a required semester away during their junior year, which can be an internship, research, community service, or an entrepreneurial or international experience. The Institute has implemented The New Polytechnic, a new model for scientific and technological education that emphasizes collaboration and leadership across disciplines and sectors to address urgent global challenges. Rensselaer is home to one of the world's most powerful university-based supercomputers, housed in the Center for Computational Innovations. The Institute is also home to several other unique research facilities including the Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies and the Curtis R. Priem Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center, which provides a platform for exploration and learning at the nexus of research, technology, and the performing arts.", "totalUndergrads": 6283, "totalGradsAndPros": 1333, "pctPell": 17, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 69, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 31}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 0.4, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 21, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 79}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", ""], ["sorority housing", ""], ["fraternity housing", ""], ["apartment for single students", ""], ["special housing for disabled students", ""], ["theme housing", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 16, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 84}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 12, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 88}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Offered on campus", "csAvgCost": 35464, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 22662, "nptMed1": 24361, "nptMed2": 26797, "nptHi1": 34046, "nptHi2": 43869}, "netPriceCalculator": "http://npc.collegeboard.org/app/rpi", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 25000, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 8915, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 22135, "mdIncDebtMdn": 23250, "hiIncDebtMdn": 21693}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 239, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 40450, "pctIncuredDebt": 60, "vGiBill": 1, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 49, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 296, "regAlcPermYesno": "No", "vGuiServAva": ["co-op education", "on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "women's center", "placement service", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Since 2000, Rensselaer has invested over $859 million in new and existing buildings.

There's something special about living and learning in one of the most innovative places on Earth, where more than 80 percent of our students have at least one internship before graduating and undergraduates conduct important research alongside professors in a way that is usually reserved for graduate students. The University blends a sense of tradition and history--as the oldest college in California--with a vision that values innovation and a deep commitment to social justice. SCU's 585 full-time faculty members include Fulbright professors, nationally recognized authors and poets, groundbreaking scientists, and highly regarded economic forecasters. SCU has three Centers of Distinction that serve as major points of interaction between the University and local and global communities. The mission of the Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship is to accelerate global, innovation-based entrepreneurship in service to humanity. The Ignatian Center for Jesuit Education promotes and enhances the distinctively Jesuit, Catholic tradition of education at Santa Clara University. And the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics brings the traditions of ethical thinking to bear on real-world problems. We offer an experience so great that 93 percent of first-year students return for their sophomore year. People of all backgrounds flourish here. One thing they have in common? They want to make a difference. Santa Clara students are driven to build a better, kinder, more humane, and more sustainable planet. Distinguished nationally by one of the highest graduation rates, SCU provides rigorous undergraduate curricula in the arts and sciences, business, and engineering.

Collaborations with the University of Maryland, Baltimore through the University of Maryland Strategic Partnership also boost educational opportunities, research and combined degree programs. UMD is proud to be the nation's first \"Do Good\" campus. The Do Good Initiative is a campus-wide effort to engage the entire student body in programs designed to ensure that every student who graduates from UMD will do so informed and motivated to Do Good in their communities and around the world. As part of the Do Good Initiative, UMD hosts the annual \"Do Good Challenge,\" which inspires and rewards students to become social entrepreneurs. Undergraduates can select from nearly 280 academic programs, or create their own as part of the Individual Studies Program. UMD provides countless out-of-classroom opportunities, more than 25 living-learning environments, and more than 400 study abroad programs to empower students to make a global impact. Half of UMD's fall freshmen enroll in living-learning and other honors or scholars programs. The Honors College challenges the most talented students in small seminars with like-minded classmates. College Park Scholars, an innovative living-learning program, engages students and faculty in learning beyond the classroom around a variety of topic areas. UMD is among the most diverse public flagships in the nation, recognizing that a diverse educational community is one of its greatest strengths. UMD's faculty includes two Nobel laureates, three Pulitzer Prize winners and 56 members of the National Academies, who provide leadership in pivotal fields, such as quantum science, climate change, national security and visual art. UMD researchers are heavily involved in transdisciplinary environmental research, including work to restore and protect the nearby Chesapeake Bay.  New and upcoming buildings on campus enhance the university's academic and research mission, including the Edward St. John Learning and Teaching Center, focused on a student-centered approach to instruction and discovery; A. James Clark Hall, designed to catalyze engineering innovation and bioengineering breakthroughs; the Brendan Iribe Center for Computer Science and Innovation, which will support the next wave of research in virtual and augmented reality; and the new Cole Field House, where innovators, scientists, clinicians and athletes will converge to advance the science of sport. Only nine miles from the White House, the Smithsonian, Library of Congress, and National Archives, and near the metropolitan and educational attractions of Baltimore, the lush 1,335-acre campus is about to be more connected than ever. With five new light rail stops on our around campus, the forthcoming Purple Line mass transit system will further connect UMD to all the region has to offer. UMD's entire campus and its 14,000 trees are designated as an arboretum and botanical garden, and the Arbor Day Foundation has recognized UMD as a Tree Campus USA(r) for 10 consecutive years.

learning and one of the nation's first engineering and technology universities. At this distinctive, top-tier technological university, students are challenged to solve real-world problems that matter to society. Academics at WPI center on engineering, science, technology, and mathematics, and the university has rigorous programs in its Foisie Business School, the arts and humanities, and the social sciences. Its 17 academic departments offer more than 70 undergraduate and graduate degree programs, leading to the BA, BS, MS, MEng, MBA, MFA, and PhD. Excellence in undergraduate education is paramount at WPI. Students work closely with faculty who are guided by the principle that students learn most effectively and demonstrate their proficiency most accurately by applying the theory learned in the classroom to the practice of solving authentic problems. All WPI undergraduates complete a humanities and arts requirement and at least two significant projects, one in the major field of study and one that addresses an open-ended problem at the intersection of science, technology, and society. They gain an appreciation for how their work has an impact on local, national, and even global communities. First-year students may participate in the Great Problems Seminar, a two-term introduction to university-level research and projects focused on current global themes. WPI's Global Projects Program provides students the opportunity to make a difference in communities and organizations around the world in one of its more than 50 project centers throughout the Americas, Africa, Asia-Pacific, and Europe. Off-campus opportunities are plentiful. WPI established its first off-campus residential project center in 1974 in Washington, D.C., and its first international center in 1987 in London. More than two-thirds of each graduating WPI class has traveled off campus to complete projects, half going overseas. Working independently or collaboratively with faculty or industry partners, graduate students are challenged to engage in research with a purpose, offering contributions that lead to breakthroughs in problems facing society. Students are inspired to consider the big picture and to think like entrepreneurs. They look for innovative solutions that aren't always obvious but will have the greatest technical and social impact. Faculty and students collaborate to pursue groundbreaking interdisciplinary research that meets ongoing challenges in health and biotechnology; robotics and the internet of things; advanced materials and manufacturing; cyber, data, and security systems; and learning sciences. Students explore their creative sides in WPI's thriving music and theatre departments, while quirky traditions, like the annual Pi Day festivities or celebrating the birthday of its mascot, Gompei the goat, foster a sense of community. Notable WPI academic and research centers include the Metal Processing Institute, the largest industry-university alliance in North America. Gateway Park houses the 125,000-sq.-ft. Life Sciences and Bioengineering Center and the university's graduate research programs in these disciplines. A second building at Gateway Park houses, among other tenants, its Biomanufacturing Education and Training Center; Fire Protection Engineering Laboratory, which supports one of the world's only graduate programs in fire protection engineering; PracticePoint, to advance medical devices and healthcare technologies; and LEAP, a lab to support the integrated photonics manufacturing sector. WPI's 38,000+ alumni are located throughout the U.S. and in more than 100 countries.

Because giving back is an important part of the SMU experience, Mustangs apply big ideas to challenging problems, locally and globally, through opportunities such as the Engaged Learning program, the Hunt Institute for Engineering and Humanity and the Deason Innovation Gym. Students from any major or school can also access diverse resources for starting a business or organization, including startup incubators and innovation spaces; the SMU Entrepreneurship Club connects students across campus. (2) RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES. SMU professors are research-active scholars and great teachers, a rare combination made possible by the breadth and scale of a close-knit intellectual community. Students collaborate with faculty on projects and research as early as the first semester of their freshman year. The 11:1 student-to-faculty ratio fosters deeper learning. (3) DISTINCTIVE MAJORS. Interdisciplinary undergraduate programs include human rights, creative computing, environmental sciences and environmental studies. Students also study abroad through more than 150 programs in 50-plus countries. (4) LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT. SMU students lead nearly 200 student organizations. SMU is one of the few universities in the United States to have a voting student member on its Board of Trustees. The Tate Lecture Series, one of the top collegiate lecture programs in the nation, brings national and international leaders to campus. (5) LIVING AND LEARNING COMMUNITIES. Every first-year student becomes a member of an SMU Residential Commons, which bridges academic and social life to create a welcoming, inclusive University family. Faculty in Residence in the Residential Commons expand student opportunities for informal interactions, intellectual exchanges and mentoring. (6) UNIQUE MUSEUMS AND FACILITIES. The Meadows Museum at SMU houses one of the largest and most comprehensive collections of Spanish art outside of Spain. The George W. Bush Presidential Center includes a library, museum and independent research institute focused on national and international issues. SMU-in-Taos, a 400-acre campus in northern New Mexico, offers credit courses, including the opportunity to participate in excavation of the 13th-century Pot Creek Pueblo. /// Students who are driven to succeed make the most of the limitless opportunities created by the combined might of SMU and Dallas -- and go on to make a difference in their professions and communities around the world.", "totalUndergrads": 6827, "totalGradsAndPros": 5546, "pctPell": 11, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 51, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 49}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 0.6, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 45, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 55}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", ""], ["sorority housing", ""], ["fraternity housing", ""], ["apartments for married students", ""], ["apartment for single students", ""], ["cooperative housing", ""], ["theme housing", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 26, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 74}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 35, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 65}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered at cooperating institution", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Not offered", "csAvgCost": 36222, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 26718, "nptMed1": 27331, "nptMed2": 31813, "nptHi1": 34587, "nptHi2": 43206}, "netPriceCalculator": "www.smu.edu/EnrollmentServices/FinancialAid/NetPriceCalculator", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 21000, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 12500, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 18750, "mdIncDebtMdn": 19500, "hiIncDebtMdn": 16500}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 200, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 33575, "pctIncuredDebt": 31, "vGiBill": 1, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 22, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 234, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "women's center", "placement service", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Meadows Museum art collection;

The university is a tier-one research institution and a member of the prestigious Association of American Universities. It is one of just a few universities in the nation to hold triple designations as a land-, sea-, and space-grant institution. Texas A&M is one of the most diversified and comprehensive institutions in the nation, with 17 colleges and schools, including the Health Science Center with locations across Texas, the School of Law in Fort Worth, the Higher Education Center at McAllen, a maritime branch campus in Galveston, Texas, an engineering branch in Doha, Qatar, and research and study centers in Costa Rica, Italy and Mexico.Faculty and Research: Texas A&M's 4,000 plus faculty members are some of the world's top experts, including two Nobel Prize recipients, three Wolf Prize recipients and 48 members of the National Academies.Their work--often conducted with students--yielded $1.13 billion in research expenditures in FY 2020,  making Texas A&M the first university in the state, and one of the elite few nationally, to surpass the $1 billion milestone in the most recent National Science Foundation Higher Education Research and Development survey. Examples of major research programs include the International Ocean Discovery Program (National Science Foundation, $337 million), Texas A&M Center for Innovation in Advanced Development and Manufacturing (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, $176.6 million), and Cyclotron Based Nuclear Science (U.S. Department of Energy, $43.8 million).Academics: Texas A&M offers more than 130 undergraduate degree programs and nearly 270 graduate degree programs, as well as professional degrees in law, veterinary medicine, medicine, dentistry, nursing, pharmacy, and public health. With a student body of more than 71,000 (in fall 2020, with about 66,000 at the flagship College Station campus), Texas A&M ranks among the nation's largest universities. Student Leadership Development: Texas A&M provides students with transformational learning experiences. Students conduct cutting-edge research alongside world-renowned faculty, launch companies from university business incubators, and collaborate across disciplines to create, discover and innovate. In keeping with its mission of preparing students to compete in the increasingly global marketplace, Texas A&M ranks first among American public universities in the number of students studying abroad and in the number of students participating in credit-bearing international experiences.  Students hone their skills through more than 1,100 student organizations, including The Big Event, the nation's largest student-run, one-day, community service activity, with more than 20,000 participants each year.In recent years, Texas A&M has been ranked first in the nation for the most graduates serving as CEOs of Fortune 500 companies (Fortune), the only public university in Texas named a best buy for providing a superior education at an affordable cost (Fiske) and the best value college education in Texas (Money).Students graduate with less college-related debt and earn more at mid-career than most of their peers from other universities. Nearly 90 percent of recent Texas A&M graduates surveyed were \"very\" or \"extremely\" satisfied with their education, compared to only half of all graduates nationally.", "totalUndergrads": 55568, "totalGradsAndPros": 14850, "pctPell": 21, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 52, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 48}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 1.1, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 20, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 80}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", ""], ["women's dorms", ""], ["men's dorms", ""], ["apartments for married students", ""], ["apartment for single students", ""], ["special housing for disabled students", ""], ["wellness housing", ""], ["other housing options", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 0, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 0}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 0, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 0}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Offered on campus", "csAvgCost": 19057, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 11454, "nptMed1": 13270, "nptMed2": 18810, "nptHi1": 26028, "nptHi2": 27666}, "netPriceCalculator": "https://www.highered.texas.gov/institutional-resources-programs/net-price-calculator/", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 18445, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 7500, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 13887, "mdIncDebtMdn": 15691, "hiIncDebtMdn": 15500}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 176, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 24621, "pctIncuredDebt": 41, "vGiBill": 3, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 31, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 5200, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["co-op education", "on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "women's center", "placement service", "day care", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "George Bush Presidential Library and Museum; J.

The university also offers a robust study abroad program, with students living and learning across the globe. The nationally recognized Commonwealth Honors College welcomes students who seek additional academic challenge and meet the requirements for acceptance. Students in the Honors College live together in their residential complex, while accessing all the resources the university offers, including the largest library system of any public institution in the Northeast. In recent years, the campus has undergone a facilities renaissance, with new academic buildings for team-based learning as well as student-centered spaces, including the totally renovated Student Union Building and the Worcester Commons, which offers student lounges, contemplative space and the best college food in the country. The campus is also deeply committed to sustainability and is ranked one of the \"greenest\" universities in the countryThrough the Five College Consortium, students can enroll in classes at nearby Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, and Smith colleges at no extra charge. A free bus system connects these five campuses, allowing students to participate in a wide array of social and cultural events. In the Residential First-Year Experience, first-year students live with peers who share common interests and experiences. Other opportunities for personal development are found through more than 500 clubs and organizations. Areas of involvement include community service, student governance, ethnic and cultural groups, religion and spirituality, Greek Life, student-run businesses, media, academic interests, athletics and recreation, arts, entertainment, and politics. Students create organizations based on their interests, making opportunities limitless. UMass Amherst competes in NCAA Division I Intercollegiate Athletics. Students can attend every home game for free in regular season, and proudly wear maroon while cheering on the Minutemen and Minutewomen. All students can workout at the immensely popular Recreation Center, and any student who wants to engage in athletic competition can participate in an extensive intramural sports program. UMass Dining Services is consistently ranked tops in the country. Just off campus, the town of Amherst offers scores of shops and restaurants from Mexican or Thai, to pizza, burgers and Indian.

They develop deep connections to the thought leaders, award-winning scholars, and committed teachers that make up the university's faculty. Active and engaged, AU students have the opportunity to address major issues - from health care to human rights and global economics to the environment - by participating in internships at pinnacle organizations in government, business, and nonprofits.

Hunt Jr. Library, winner of the prestigious Stanford Prize for Innovation in Research Libraries and one of the most technologically advanced learning and collaboration spaces in the world.NC State's groundbreaking innovations in science and technology have led the federal government to select the university to lead some of the nation's most ambitious research partnerships, including an institute creating the next generation of power electronics, a laboratory advancing the science of big data analysis, and a consortium fighting the illegal proliferation of nuclear weapons. NC State leads two of the National Science Foundation's Engineering Research Centers -- one remaking the nation's electrical grid, and the other developing self-powered health monitors that use nanotechnology. In addition, NC State was the first university in North America to establish an IBM Q Hub as part of the global IBM Q Network, a collaborative effort to advance quantum computing.NC State is a national leader in giving students the opportunity to learn how to solve real-world problems, so it's no wonder that it's one of just eight universities ranked in the top 20 for both undergraduate and graduate entrepreneurship by the Princeton Review and Entrepreneur magazine. NC State alumni also enjoy the highest starting salaries among the state's public university graduates, and they graduate with below-average debt. Year after year, NC State is nationally ranked as one of the best values in higher education for its combination of high academic standards, generous financial aid and affordable tuition.The university's programs in honors education, living-and-learning communities, study abroad, cooperative education and service learning give students boundless opportunities to develop the personal and professional skills they need to put knowledge into practice throughout their lives.For more information about NC State, visit ncsu.edu/about/rankings/", "totalUndergrads": 26150, "totalGradsAndPros":

For more than 130 years, we have inspired students to Be The Difference in their professional and personal lives. More than 11,000 students come from almost all 50 states and 70 countries to explore options ranging from intense undergraduate studies to specialized graduate and professional programs. The University Core of Common Studies is the intellectual heart of a Marquette undergraduate education, built on our Jesuit tradition and designed for successful life in the 21st century. Based on this foundation in nine essential knowledge areas, students can take advantage of dozens of majors offered through the colleges of Arts and Sciences, Business Administration, Communication, Education, Engineering, Health Sciences, Nursing and Professional Studies. At the graduate level, Marquette has Wisconsins only dental school, as well as a nationally ranked Law School, Graduate School and Graduate School of Management. Marquettes location just west of downtown Milwaukee provides easy access to internship and job opportunities with government agencies, small businesses, Fortune 500 companies and nonprofit institutions. Students can also take advantage of entertainment venues ranging from the Lake Michigan shoreline to the performing arts, ethnic and fine dining, professional sports, and an active nightlife.But your education doesnt need to be limited to Milwaukee. Each year, many Marquette students grab their passports, pack their bags and head off to distant lands to study for a few weeks, a semester or a year. Marquette offers study abroad and exchange program opportunities on every continent but Antarctica. And, if you want to go there, we can probably arrange something for you. If you prefer to stay in the states, Marquettes Les Aspin Center for Government in Washington, D.C., is one of the countrys top legislative internship programs. For a semester or a summer, you can live, learn and work on Capitol Hill. Take an active role in the legislative process while you work as an intern or aide in the House of Representatives, the Senate or various federal agencies. Youll also take special courses and meet with government officials and dignitaries and become well-connected in a city where connections are everything.On campus, with more than 250 student organizations vying for your time, you wont be bored. And because most of our students spend their weekends on campus, theres plenty to do here and around the city. The Raynor Memorial Libraries offer areas for quiet and group study, as well as wireless Internet access and a coffee shop. When students arent studying, you can find them enjoying our two recreation centers and campus green spots. Our students also dont hesitate to get out into the community, and 90 percent of undergraduates participate in service through a wide range of programs, student organizations, service-learning classes and one-day projects. Are you a sports fan? Youre at the right place. Whether youre a big-time intercollegiate athlete or a die-hard spectator, Marquette offers a huge variety of opportunities, including 16 varsity teams that compete in the Big East Conference. If club and recreational sports are more your speed, we have about 50 coed, mens or womens clubs and intramural teams.", "totalUndergrads": 8024, "totalGradsAndPros": 3526, "pctPell": 20, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 45, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 55}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 0.8, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 45, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 55}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", ""], ["men's dorms", ""], ["sorority housing", ""], ["fraternity housing", ""], ["apartments for married students", ""], ["apartment for single students", ""], ["special housing for disabled students", ""], ["special housing for international students", ""], ["cooperative housing", ""], ["theme housing", ""], ["wellness housing", ""], ["other housing options", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 0, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 0}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 0, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 0}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Offered on campus", "csAvgCost": 29756, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 19169, "nptMed1": 20955, "nptMed2": 25492, "nptHi1": 31034, "nptHi2": 36734}, "netPriceCalculator": "https://tcc.ruffalonl.com/Marquette University/Freshman-Students", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 24500, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 5500, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 18594, "mdIncDebtMdn": 19336, "hiIncDebtMdn": 21500}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 234, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 36321, "pctIncuredDebt": 55, "vGiBill": 1, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 45, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 107, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["co-op education", "on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "placement service", "day care", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Student patrols", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Engineering Hall, home of the College of Engineering, a living laboratory for discovery learning;

"Stevens Institute of Technology is a premier technological research university focused on advancing technology and science to solve the world's most pressing challenges and transform our future. Located in Hoboken, New Jersey - one of the nation's top-rated college towns - the Stevens experience delivers a mix of cosmopolitan life (restaurants, arts and culture abound); riverside green spaces; skyline views; and easy access to New York City, the world's financial and media capital, 10 minutes away by train or ferry. The university's forward-thinking, technology-first approach has yielded outstanding outcomes for students, who are highly sought after by leading employers and top graduate and professional schools: 95% of Stevens graduates achieve their intended outcomes within six months of graduating. Known for stellar engineering programs since its founding in 1870, the university has nimbly leveraged its technology orientation over the past 150 years to develop additional high-impact programs in business, the arts and the humanities including programs in quantitative finance, science and technology studies, visual arts technology and music technology. Stevens research addresses challenges in critical areas including artificial intelligence, finance, healthcare, cybersecurity, sustainability and complex systems. The university also possesses the agility to rapidly develop new programming in response to the evolving needs of business, industry and society; the curriculum incorporates a unique blend of technical rigor, team problem-solving exercises and entrepreneurial training -- creating tremendous value both for students and the companies who recruit and employ them. Robust internship and cooperative education programs, and personal attention from a career center recognized as among the very best in the nation, further prepare Stevens students for highly competitive job markets. Graduates emerge prepared to hit the ground running in today's complex, cross-functional, highly technical work environment, then advance rapidly in the workplace, earning some of the highest starting and mid-career salaries in the nation and realizing very high ROI (return on investment). Alumni, faculty and students have long earned global recognition as tech pioneers, CEOs and game-changers for accomplishments ranging from the invention of IMAP email and Bubble Wrap to the student-designed solar home SURE House, which won first prize in the 2015 U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon and is now a permanent exhibit at Liberty Science Center in New Jersey. This momentum has led to Stevens' inclusion in U.S. News & World Report's select list of \"Most Innovative Schools\" and a host of other institutional honors and awards. The university has also made a significant commitment to enhance diversity and access through the A. James Clark Scholars Program to provide financial support and enhanced learning opportunities for talented students underrepresented in the engineering field and the Stevens ACES (Accessing Careers in Engineering and Science) program, which encourages talented high school students from underserved communities to pursue STEM careers and educations. In addition, Stevens has created a more supportive environment for women: according to Forbes it is one of three U.S. universities where female graduates out-earn men. Stevens students are intelligent, motivated and involved: they embrace possibility, chase opportunity and welcome challenges. This spirit extends to life both on and off campus, from the performing arts to community service, from club and varsity sports to entrepreneurial ventures that take root as viable businesses and services. With more than 100 student clubs and organizations on campus, 25 NCAA Division III athletics teams to play and cheer for, and a vibrant, exciting city to call home, Stevens students truly have it all at their fingertips.", "totalUndergrads": 3670, "totalGradsAndPros": 3466, "pctPell": 18, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 71, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 29}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 0.5, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 17, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 83}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", "93%"], ["women's dorms", ""], ["sorority housing", ""], ["fraternity housing", ""], ["apartment for single students", "7%"], ["theme housing", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 21, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 79}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 31, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 69}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered at cooperating institution", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered at cooperating institution", "vRotcOffNavy": "Offered at cooperating institution", "csAvgCost": 37588, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 26709, "nptMed1": 27894, "nptMed2": 29774, "nptHi1": 34801, "nptHi2": 43965}, "netPriceCalculator": "https://npc.collegeboard.org/student/app/stevens", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 26950, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 11625, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 23000, "mdIncDebtMdn": 26995, "hiIncDebtMdn": 24975}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 257, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 51251, "pctIncuredDebt": 67, "vGiBill": 0, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 60, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 55, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["co-op education", "on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "women's center", "placement service", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Davidson Ocean Eng Lab (High Speed Towing Tank & Oblique Sea Basins), Design & Manufacturing Institute, Highly Filled Materials Institute, Computer Vision Lab, Ultrafast Laser Spectroscopy Lab, Light & Life Lab, Nanoscale Device Lab, Electron Microscopy Lab, Center for Environmental Systems, Wireless Network Security Center, Center for Maritime Systems, Software Eng Lab, Maker Center, NJ Center for Microchemical Systems, SCENE Lab, Hanlon Financial Systems Center, STAR, Center for Neuromechanics", "vProServAva": ["reading machines", "note-taking services", "readers", "extended time for tests", "tutors", "priority seating", "exams on tape or computer"], "vGuiSpePgm": ["note-taking services", "tape recorders", "special housing", "tutors", "adaptive equipment", "reader services", "braille services", "interpreters for hearing-impaired", "talking books"], "guidnceCmpsAcsblty": "Fully"}, {"primaryKey": "3636", "xwalkId": "228875", "urlName": "tcu", "displayName": "Texas Christian University", "shortName": "TCU", "city": "Fort Worth", "state": "TX", "zip": "76129", "website": "http://www.tcu.edu", "streetAddress1": "2800 S.

The Henry B. Tippie College of Business, the Roy J. and Lucille A. Carver College of Medicine, and the Colleges of Dentistry, Education, Engineering, Law, Nursing, Pharmacy and Public Health enroll undergraduates, and provide graduate education in conjunction with the Graduate College. Located in Iowa City, designated a City of Literature by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Iowa is home to acclaimed writing programs like the world-renowned Writers Workshop, the International Writing Program, and the Playwrights Workshop. Its research programs in hydroscience, brain science, and speech and hearing are world-renowned, and it operates one of the country's most advanced and comprehensive university-owned teaching hospitals. The University of Iowa enrolls more than 30,000 students, yet 81 percent of its undergraduate classes have fewer than 30 students. Students can choose from more than 200 areas of study and over 600 student organizations.  A University-wide honors program is dedicated to advancing Iowa's best students and the Center for Research by Undergraduates helps students connect with mentors and research opportunities in every discipline, and 96% of graduates find jobs or are accepted to graduate school within six months of graduation.  Sports fans enjoy Big Ten and NCAA Division I athletics for 21 Hawkeye varsity squads and more than 170 home events each year. Recreation facilities, including a  $69-million 215,000-square-foot Campus Recreation and Wellness Center, offer opportunities to swim, run, lift weights, climb, and more. The picturesque campus is adjacent to downtown Iowa City, home to numerous coffee houses, restaurants, clothing boutiques, and other local shops.

A degree from Stony Brook -- an institution with award-winning faculty, accomplished students, rigorous and innovative academic programs, significant research opportunities and a proven track record of successful alumni -- opens doors to countless career possibilities. A member of the prestigious Association of American Universities, Stony Brook offers more than 200 majors, minors and combined-degree programs for undergraduates; first-rate opportunities for undergraduate research, including at nearby Brookhaven National Laboratory, which Stony Brook has a role in running; and Long Island's premier academic medical center. The university's diverse campus attracts more than 27,000 students from nearly all 50 states and more than 100 countries. Although it is a large university, Stony Brook has a small-college feel. Freshmen belong to one of six Undergraduate Colleges organized around students' interests. Each Undergraduate College is a structured community that offers academic and residential advising to help students schedule classes, choose a major and adjust to college life. There are many opportunities to take one-credit themed classes in small-group settings and attend informal gatherings with faculty and fellow students. Stony Brook's combined-degree programs for undergraduates include several secondary teacher preparation programs and bachelor's/MPH programs, a fast-track MBA program, and bachelor's/MD and bachelor's/DDS combined-degree programs. The School of Journalism offers a major in journalism and a state-of-the-art newsroom. Students in the School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences conduct research on the research vessel Seawolf, at the waterfront Marine Sciences Center in Stony Brook Southampton, and in Jamaica, West Indies, at Discovery Bay Lab. In fact, Stony Brook offers many unique semester, academic-year and winter and summer study-abroad programs in many countries. Students majoring in biomedical engineering combine their interests in biology, chemistry, computer programming, engineering and math. Student clubs and academic advising support students heading toward careers in engineering, law, medicine and a range of health professions. Every spring, the university pays tribute to students' accomplishments in all the arts and sciences with a day of exhibition and performance. Stony Brook has more than 400 clubs and organizations for students and offers an extensive intramural program. Stony Brook traditions include the Roth Pond Regatta, in which students, faculty and staff race boats made with only cardboard, duct tape and paint. Other traditions include Homecoming and Strawberry Fest. The Student Activities Center features an international food court, student lounges, an art gallery and the Wellness Center for exercise classes and workshops. Across campus, the Sports Complex features courts for basketball and squash, a running track, a dance studio and weight rooms. Next to it, the 85,000-square-foot Walter J. Hawrys Campus Recreation Center houses a three-court gymnasium, multipurpose indoor arena and cardio machines. Each residential quad also has its own fully equipped fitness center that is open 24/7. And the Division I Seawolves compete in an 12,300-seat stadium and a 4,000-seat arena. Stony Brook graduates are in high demand in the workplace: Nearly 380 corporate organizations recruit on campus every year. Stony Brook University's 1,040-acre campus is located on Long Island's North Shore, 60 miles east of New York City and close to beaches and woodlands. Stony Brook's proximity to New York City and a railroad station right on campus make it easy for students to take advantage of all that Manhattan has to offer.

The youngest campus in the storied University of California system quickly became the fastest-growing public university in the country, according to the U.S. Department of Education, was named one of the top young universities in the world by Times Higher Ed and is the youngest to earn a Carnegie R2 classification. UC Merced approaches the UC mission of teaching, research and public service through five portals that focus our institutional and intellectual priorities: educational opportunity; health care; economic revitalization; sustainability; and building civic capacity.  Nearly three-quarters of the over 9,000 undergraduate and graduate students are the first in their families to attend college. A federally designated Hispanic-Serving Institution, UC Merced is also No. 7 in the nation for student outcomes and No. 5 in social mobility (U.S. News and World Report). UC Merced is the only U.S. research university to have more than 60 percent Pell Grant-eligible undergraduates and a graduation rate over 60 percent.   These students learn from faculty who rank 13th   among U.S. public institutions in undergraduate teaching (U.S. News), and who explore a wealth of research areas that affect the region, state, nation and world. Through centers such as the Health Sciences Research Institute, Sierra Nevada Research Institute, Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society, and the NASA-funded Merced nAnomaterials Center for Energy and Sensing, these thought leaders create knowledge alongside graduate and undergraduate students in settings that extend beyond the lab.  The campus location provides a unique opportunity for research and stewardship crucial to the Central Valley and the state of California. A strong relationship with Yosemite National Park enables important studies in climate change, water and biological diversity at longtime field stations, while also educating the park leaders of the future through the Yosemite Leadership Program. The UC Merced Vernal Pools and Grassland Reserve is a living lab in one of the largest ecosystems of its kind in California. And proximity to Silicon Valley and the Bay Area affords opportunities to interact with industry leaders in technology and innovation. UC Merced recently completed its ambitious Merced 2020 Project, a $1.2 billion public-private partnership (P3) that nearly doubled the square footage of the campus. The project is the largest P3 social infrastructure project completed in U.S. history and enables the campus to accommodate up to 10,000 students. The new facilities include student housing, classrooms, teaching and research space, student wellness and counseling facilities and recreational spaces.  UC Merced is the only U.S. campus with every building LEED-certified, including 11 of the Merced 2020 Project buildings which are certified LEED Platinum, the highest honor available by the U.S. Green Building Council. Sustainability is in UC Merced's DNA. It is the first public research university in the country to achieve carbon neutrality, two years ahead of its goal.

Today under the leadership of President Dennis Assanis, the University is committed to building on this legacy to meet the great challenges facing the world. The University's first and most important priority remains to ensure the success of every student, and this commitment dates back to our roots as a small private academy founded in 1743. From that early school, which educated three signers of the Declaration of Independence, the University of Delaware has grown into a research-intensive, technologically advanced institution that is at the forefront of innovation in the classroom, in the laboratory and in the community. Chartered by the State of Delaware in 1833, the University was designated one of the nation's historic Land-Grant colleges in 1867. Today it also holds the rare distinction of being a Sea Grant and a Space Grant institution. Among its other distinctive accomplishments, UD is classified by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching as a Doctoral University - Highest Research Activity--a designation accorded less than 3% of U.S. colleges and universities. UD also ranks among the nation's top 100 universities in federal R&D support for science and engineering, and in terms of research spending it ranks 32nd among 500 universities without a medical school. Since 2016, annual sponsored research expenditures have increased by 23%, including the creation of institutes and centers. State-assisted and privately governed, the University of Delaware offers more than 150 majors and minors, and some 250 graduate and post-baccalureate programs. UD's more than 23,600 students come from across the country and around the world, including some 18,600 undergraduates, more than 4,200 graduate students and some 700 students enrolled in professional and continuing studies. UD's four-year graduation rate of 73% places it fourth in the nation among primarily residential four-year public institutions. UD's thriving study-abroad program--the first in the nation--and expanding international partnerships further enhance students' education as global citizens. About a third of UD students study abroad during their undergraduate careers, and the innovative World Scholars Program offers students the opportunity to make global studies and travel integral to their UD experience, including studying in Rome, Madrid, Auckland or Athens. The distinguished faculty includes internationally known scientists, authors and artists, among them Guggenheim and Fulbright fellows and members of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The University's main campus in Newark has won accolades for the beauty of its traditional Georgian architecture. A recent addition in Newark is the Science, Technology and Advanced Research (STAR) Campus that combines top academics and research to partner with industry and the community. Today is it a bustling hub of activity, adding 750,000 square feet of state-of-the-art facilities and beginning a new era of opportunity and impact for UD. In addition to Newark, UD has a 132-acre campus in Lewes, as well as locations in Wilmington, Dover and Georgetown. In 2015, UD earned the Community Engagement Classification from the Carnegie Foundation, demonstrating its commitment to working with community partners to address societal issues. Today, there are more than 195,000 UD alumni around the world, including  U.S. President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and First Lady Dr. Jill Biden.", "totalUndergrads": 18420, "totalGradsAndPros": 4285, "pctPell": 15, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 42, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 58}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 0.7, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 7, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 93}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", ""], ["women's dorms", ""], ["sorority housing", ""], ["apartments for married students", ""], ["apartment for single students", ""], ["special housing for disabled students", ""], ["special housing for international students", ""], ["theme housing", ""], ["other housing options", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 18, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 82}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 23, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 77}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Not offered", "csAvgCost": 17220, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 11487, "nptMed1": 12236, "nptMed2": 14622, "nptHi1": 18614, "nptHi2": 23617}, "netPriceCalculator": "https://www.udel.edu/apply/undergraduate-admissions/financing-your-degree/net-price-calculator/", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 24660, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 8000, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 18615, "mdIncDebtMdn": 20500, "hiIncDebtMdn": 21500}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 235, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 39705, "pctIncuredDebt": 60, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 46, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 1996, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "placement service", "day care", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Student patrols", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "The Ammon Pinizzotto Biopharmaceutical Innovation Center houses the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL) and research labs in pharmaceutical discovery and medical sciences.

Selected as one of only about 45 \"Changemaker\" campuses worldwide, USDs renowned professors and innovative students are committed to extending the educational experience beyond the confines of the classroom and into the world at large. Thus, in addition to receiving an outstanding education from one of the nations premier universities, USD students are immersed in an environment that is dedicated to creating change on a global scale. Located on the Pacific Rim just 22 miles from the Mexican border, USD is optimally positioned for international activity. From learning about border relations to studying abroad through a variety of programs, USD students are known for their extensive international experience and global perspective, which has resulted in the university consistently being ranked among the top three in the nation for study abroad participation. Offering over 80 international programs in 30 different countries, USDs study abroad program has received national attention for its expansive, varied, and accessible learning opportunities for students. Over 70% of USD students study abroad during their collegiate career, many of whom participate more than once. Whether overseas or on campus, there is one constant in the USD experience: student activities are never lacking. Centrally located in Americas Finest City, USDs 180 acre suburban campus boasts not only beautiful Spanish Renaissance architecture and state of the art facilities but also a dynamic campus community where activities abound. Home to over 175 clubs and organizations, 17 NCAA Division I sports teams and a variety of Greek and honor societies, there is truly something for everyone at USD. Nestled in the heart of San Diego, students are also able to navigate their surrounding city with ease. From frequenting popular hangouts at the beach to strolling through downtown's vibrant Gaslamp Quarter, students can always find something new to explore. In fact, exploration is an essential aspect to the USD life, as all new students are immersed in a first-year experience program that engages students both academically and socially. Over 95% of freshman live on campus at USD, all of whom live in themed residential areas known as Living Learning Communities, or LLCs. LLC themes range from advocacy to sustainability and house students within a core community of likeminded individuals. Each LLC takes part in a variety of activities throughout the academic year, some of which include: intellectual dinners and debates, trips to the theatre and even swimming with sharks. LLCs also play a central role in USDs rigorous and engaging liberal arts curriculum, as each students residential area ties into their first semester coursework. Although a beautiful, dynamic campus and nearby beaches are certainly nice perks, the primary focus at USD is to provide students with an outstanding, personalized academic experience. With an undergraduate population of about 5,800, USD fosters an individualized learning environment in which class sizes average only 22 students and every single course is taught by a member of the faculty. The university's undergraduate model is founded in the liberal arts tradition, defined by a comprehensive core curriculum and strongly encourages interdisciplinary study and research. A USD education begins on campus, is strengthened by solid academic preparation and practical experience and produces cultured, global-minded, and sought-after graduates ready to make a real difference in the world.", "totalUndergrads": 5529, "totalGradsAndPros": 3332, "pctPell": 17, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 43, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 57}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 3.3, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 16, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 84}, "vHouOff": [["women's dorms", ""], ["men's dorms", ""], ["apartment for single students", ""], ["special housing for disabled students", ""], ["theme housing", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 21, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 79}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 31, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 69}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered at cooperating institution", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered at cooperating institution", "vRotcOffNavy": "Offered on campus", "csAvgCost": 32460, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 22263, "nptMed1": 23224, "nptMed2": 25727, "nptHi1": 30369, "nptHi2": 41679}, "netPriceCalculator": "http://www.sandiego.edu/admissions/undergraduate/tuition-financial-aid/net-price-calculator.php", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 23049, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 8250, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 21500, "mdIncDebtMdn": 21497, "hiIncDebtMdn": 19500}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 220, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 28946, "pctIncuredDebt": 45, "vGiBill": 4, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 37, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 180, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "women's center", "placement service", "day care", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Joan B.

CU Boulder is one of 35  U.S. public institutions belonging to the prestigious Association of American Universities (AAU). While it is a major research university and Colorado's flagship university, the campus maintains an intimate college atmosphere with many small academic communities and 83% of classes enrolling fewer than 50 students.The university has a proud academic tradition, with five Nobel laureates, eight MacArthur \"genius grant\" recipients, and more than 100 Fulbright fellows since 1982. CU Boulder has a long history of environmental awareness and has been ranked among the top \"green\" universities in the country. We are home of the founding chapter of Engineers Without Borders and in 2020 were again ranked as one of the top sources of Peace Corps volunteers. The university received more than $613 million in sponsored research funding during the 2019-20 fiscal year. Faculty members bring their research into the classroom in areas such as physics, space sciences, and the American West.CU Boulder offers more than 4,400 courses in approximately 160 areas of study and over 80 degree programs at the bachelor's level. Undergraduates apply to the following colleges, schools, and programs: Arts & Sciences; Leeds School of Business; Engineering & Applied Science; Music; Environmental Design; Education; Media, Communication and Information; and the newest program, Program in Exploratory Studies. The exploratory studies program doesn't require students to pick one major right away, offering resources and guidance to help students discover and shape their academic and career journey.University facilities include an observatory, planetarium, mountain research station, a hands-on teaching and learning laboratory for engineering, and the Alliance for Teaching, Learning, & Society Center, a structure that offers the university community groundbreaking instructional technology and learning opportunities. Outstanding departments and programs include aerospace engineering, astrophysical and planetary sciences, biochemistry, biology, chemistry, engineering, English, entrepreneurial business, geography, integrative physiology, law, music, physics, and psychology.Talented undergraduate students participate in a variety of enrichment opportunities on campus, including honors programs, the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program, community and service learning, and 12 residential academic programs that offer specialized living and learning communities featuring top faculty and small-class environments. Students come from every state in the nation and approximately 70 countries. Many ethnic, religious, and social backgrounds are represented, fostering a multicultural community that enriches each student's educational experience. Students from diverse backgrounds may receive academic, personal, and financial support through one of the CU-Lead (leadership, excellence, achievement, and diversity) alliance programs housed in various colleges and departments.The Study Abroad Office administers almost 400 CU Boulder-sponsored programs in nearly 70 countries around the world, with approximately 1,400 students participating annually.CU Boulder competes in 12 intercollegiate sports at the Division I level, is a member of the Pac-12 Conference, and maintains one of the nation's largest club sports programs, supporting 30 intercollegiate teams in sports such as cycling, ice hockey, swimming/diving, triathlon, and ultimate Frisbee.The campus offers art galleries, a natural history museum, theaters, concert halls, and an extensive calendar of social and cultural events, highlighted by the annual Conference on World Affairs, musical performances by the Grammy Award-winning Takacs Quartet, and the Colorado Shakespeare

something about the University of Oregon. Ducks live in an exceptional academic community surrounded by a city alive with music, culture, food, and art--you might call it Northwest of normal. Our home is populated by scientists, champions, explorers, builders, and storytellers: people who aren't afraid to try, fail, and try again, who work together to find a better way. With more than 300 academic programs to choose from, Ducks have a world of inquiry at their webbed feet. It's no accident that the College of Arts and Sciences is at the heart of the university. Every UO student graduates with a broad liberal arts and sciences degree, regardless of major. Ducks learn to question critically, solve problems, and communicate clearly--skills that 93% of employers say are more important than an employee's major. Looking for an intellectual challenge? The Robert D. Clark Honors College is the oldest of its kind in the United States. A comic studies program? We have the first in the country. If something more scientific appeals, the UO is at the nucleus of integrative science studies. The UO's School of Journalism and Communications, headed by Pulitzer Prize-winning authors and journalists, leads the way in studying and implementing brands, media, design, and creative culture. In the Lundquist College of Business, students manage real investments, launch real startups, and work on real problems for real companies. It's just one of the reasons amazing companies are interested in hiring UO students when they graduate. Ducks join First-Year Interest Groups that bring people together based on powerful ideas and provide opportunities to interact with and learn from each other. The UO is also deeply committed to research. Our faculty, graduate, and undergraduate researchers are asking questions that take students to new and better places, including exploring ways to help people live more sustainably. Chemistry faculty found ways to teach that creates the least toxic waste possible. Then they taught green chemistry to the world. Nearly 22,000 students call the UO home, and it's a pretty great home. Eugene was voted one of the greenest and most bike-friendly cities in the United States, one of the most livable cities, and one of the best college towns in the US. An hour from both the rugged Oregon coast and the Cascade mountain range, you can snowboard, or surf, or do both--in the same day. Everything here, even the geography, contributes to our inclusive environment of collaboration and innovation. Our insatiable need to explore, to experiment, to connect--that's what fuels everything at the University of Oregon. And that's what makes us Ducks.", "totalUndergrads": 18045, "totalGradsAndPros": 3707, "pctPell": 24, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 45, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 55}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 0.8, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 17, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 83}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", ""], ["sorority housing", ""], ["fraternity housing", ""], ["apartments for married students", ""], ["apartment for single students", ""], ["cooperative housing", ""], ["theme housing", ""], ["wellness housing", ""], ["other housing options", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 15, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 85}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 17, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 83}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered at cooperating institution", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Not offered", "csAvgCost": 16461, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 12690, "nptMed1": 13108, "nptMed2": 15109, "nptHi1": 22282, "nptHi2": 23691}, "netPriceCalculator": "https://financialaid.uoregon.edu/net_price_calculator", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 20500, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 8218, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 17000, "mdIncDebtMdn": 15833, "hiIncDebtMdn": 15000}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 196, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 26060, "pctIncuredDebt": 42, "vGiBill": 0, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 34, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 295, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "women's center", "placement service", "day care", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art; Museum of Natural and Cultural History; James Warsaw Sports Marketing Center; Lundquist Center for Entrepreneurship; University of Oregon Many Nations Longhouse; Green Chemistry Laboratory and Alice C.

And, when students land that job downtown, their transportation is covered. U students have access to public transportation to, from, and around campus and the Salt Lake Valley for no additional cost.The U offers an affordable investment in a high-quality and high-value degree by having one of the lowest out-of-state cost of attendance in the Pac-12, along with the opportunity to meet requirements for in-state tuition after just one year. In 2019, the university was selected as a new member of the Association of American Universities--an invitation-only, prestigious group of 65 leading research institutions marked by excellence in academic expertise and research impact, student success, and securing resources in support of core missions.

Students take classes primarily at the Lake Shore Campus, nestled alongside Lake Michigan on Chicago's north side, and at the Water Tower Campus located in the city's famous Gold Coast neighborhood. Medical students benefit from the University's clinical partnership with the Loyola University Health System and Trinity Health. Our Health Sciences Campus, located in suburban Maywood is home to Loyola's Stritch School of Medicine, Marcella Niehoff School of Nursing, and the Graduate School's biomedical programs. Loyola's reach also extends around the world. The John Felice Rome Center in Italy, the Beijing Center in China, and the Vietnam Center in Ho Chi Minh City along with more than 100 other study abroad options in 60 countries, offer students the chance to engage with the global community and economy. Loyola's 11 schools and colleges offer more than 80 undergraduate majors and more than 140 graduate, professional, and graduate-level certificate programs. Nineteen programs integrate coursework from multiple disciplines to give students an opportunity to explore and synthesize topics from a variety of viewpoints. Our distinguished faculty are leaders in their fields. They integrate research and practical experiences into the classroom. Ninety-two percent hold the highest academic degrees in their respective fields. Small classes emphasize student-to-faculty interaction and partnership opportunities in service learning and research. An undergraduate degree at Loyola takes four years (120 credit hours) to complete and includes undergraduate major requirements, the Core Curriculum, and electives. At Loyola, some of the most impactful learning takes place outside of the classroom. Students routinely give back to the community while exploring their interests and may earn academic credit for their service. Loyola offers more than 125 student clubs, activities, and organizations to connect with others, make lifelong friendships, and enjoy a richer college experience. Loyola competes in 13 NCAA Division I sports.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAt a GlanceTYPE OF UNIVERSITY: Private, Jesuit university offering undergraduate and graduate programsSIZE OF CAMPUS: Lake Shore Campus: 52 acres; Water Tower Campus: three acresNUMBER OF STUDENTS: 16,893\t total enrollment; 11,612 undergraduatesSTUDENT TO FACULTY RATIO: 14:1NUMBER OF FACULTY: 917 full-time faculty members", "totalUndergrads": 11612, "totalGradsAndPros": 5281, "pctPell": 23, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 33, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 67}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 0.1, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 1, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 99}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", "46%"], ["apartment for single students", "54%"], ["special housing for disabled students", ""], ["other housing options", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 8, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 92}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 15, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 85}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered at cooperating institution", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Offered at cooperating institution", "csAvgCost": 35407, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 29440, "nptMed1": 29788, "nptMed2": 32259, "nptHi1": 36700, "nptHi2": 39048}, "netPriceCalculator": "http://www.luc.edu/undergrad/financialaidcosts/netpricecalculator/", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 24949, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 9250, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 20000, "mdIncDebtMdn": 19500, "hiIncDebtMdn": 19500}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 238, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 33898, "pctIncuredDebt": 64, "vGiBill": 1, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 57, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 105, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "women's center", "placement service", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "theaters, art museums, digital media labs, convergence media studio, language learning resource center, neuroscience labs, clean energy lab, mock trial room, performance and specialized fine arts rooms, clinical simulation nursing laboratory, histology lab, geothermal system, ecodome greenhouse, aquaponics system showcase, artificial stream research facility, retreat and ecology campus", "vProServAva": ["reading machines", "note-taking services", "oral tests", "learning center", "readers", "extended time for tests", "tutors", "priority registration", "priority seating", "proofreading services", "substitution of courses", "typist/scribe", "exams on tape or computer", "other testing accommodations"], "vGuiSpePgm": ["note-taking services", "tape recorders", "special housing", "tutors", "adaptive equipment", "reader services", "interpreters for hearing-impaired", "talking books"], "guidnceCmpsAcsblty": "Mostly"}, {"primaryKey": "7104", "xwalkId": "204024", "urlName": "miami-university", "displayName": "Miami University--Oxford", "shortName": "Miami University", "city": "Oxford", "state": "OH", "zip": "45056", "website": "http://www.MiamiOH.edu", "streetAddress1": "501 E.

Founded in 1809, the university is located in the Miami Valley region of Ohio and is proud of the ties it maintains with the Miami Tribe, now located in Oklahoma. Here, high achieving, intellectually curious students prepare for success as they are given the opportunities of a large research university while experiencing the personalized teaching, attention, and sense of community found in the nation's best small, liberal arts colleges.A public university, Miami offers a wide range of academic programs. The bachelor's degree is offered in more than 117 areas of study in Oxford, the master's degree in 51 areas; doctoral programs are also available in 12 disciplines. At the school's regional campuses, 17 bachelor's majors and 11 associate's degrees are also offered.Dedicated to fostering an environment of engaged learning for more than 200 years, Miami faculty guide undergraduate students in conducting significant research, facilitating projects with real-world clients, and developing the leadership skills top employers seek most. As a result, Miami has been on the shortlist of \"schools where the faculty has an unusually strong commitment to undergraduate teaching\" eight times, every year since 2010. With a long-standing commitment to global learning, complete with a European center in Luxembourg, Miami University is ranked first nationally among public doctoral institutions for its percentage of undergraduate students studying abroad. With opportunities in more than 90 countries, Miami students and faculty understand the value of gaining a global perspective and seize the many opportunities to further develop cultural competencies.While providing students with a transformative and unforgettable collegiate experience, Miami is also uniquely dedicated to student success - including timely degree completion and career preparation. Miami's four-year graduation rate ranks 15th in the nation among public universities in the U.S. and students are accepted into medical and law schools at rates far above the national averages. Nearly twice as many employers recruit at Miami as at comparable universities and four times as many on-campus interviews are conducted than at peer institutions. Miami is regularly cited by national publications as a \"best value\" in higher education. Additional recognition as having a high return on tuition investment is supported by surveys and national data indicating that 96.6 percent of Miami students who graduated with a bachelor's degree from the Oxford campus in 2019-2020 were employed or continuing their education by fall 2020.The Oxford campus encompasses more than 2,000 acres.

Temple is home to more than 37,000 students, is among the 35 largest public, four-year institutions in the U.S. and offers more than 600 academic programs in 17 schools and colleges, on eight campuses, including locations in Japan and Italy. More than 3,700 distinguished faculty members; five professional schools; and dozens of renowned programs make Temple an academic powerhouse. Students enjoy the advantages and atmosphere of a large urban, public research university with the individualized attention that comes from a 13:1 student-to-faculty ratio. The majority of first-year students live on campus, where they are steps away from classes; the state-of-the-art Charles Library; the TECH Center; fitness and recreation facilities; dining options such as cafes, dining halls and food trucks; and the many arts, cultural, sports and scholarly events that happen daily at Temple and throughout the city. By living and learning in an urban environment, Temple students are well prepared for the world. Employers laud Owls for their tenacity, teamwork and talent. Students also have access to an immense alumni network nearly 350,000 strong for guidance, job opportunities and mentoring.", "totalUndergrads": 27306, "totalGradsAndPros": 9983, "pctPell": 30,

prestigious research universities, the University of California, Santa Cruz is characterized by an extraordinary commitment to undergraduate teaching and research. Nestled on 2,000 acres of redwood forest and meadow on the Central Coast of California, UC Santa Cruz is renowned for world-changing research in biomolecular engineering, physics, marine sciences, environmental sciences, astronomy and astrophysics, and international economics, among other prestigious programs. The campus is home to the national Center for Adaptive Optics, the Laboratory for Adaptive Optics, the Institute of Marine Sciences, and the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems. Research activity at UC Santa Cruz is interdisciplinary and collaborative and focuses on improving the planet and the lives of all its inhabitants. Research initiatives include the Center for Sustainable Energy and Power Systems, the Center for Collaborative Research for an Equitable California (CCREC), and the discovery of the first potentially habitable planet outside our Solar System. UC Santa Cruz's Jack Baskin School of Engineering addresses such important 21st century topics as information technology, nanotechnology, and biotechnology. The Baskin School of Engineering includes innovative majors in robotics engineering and computer game design, and it offers one of the few undergraduate majors in bioinformatics in the country. UC Santa Cruz has a distinctive residential college system in which all undergraduate students, whether they live in university housing or not, are affiliated with one of 10 colleges. In addition to housing students in small-scale residential communities, each college offers courses, provides academic support, organizes student activities, and sponsors events that enhance the intellectual and social life of the campus. College affiliation is independent of choice of major. Every college community includes students with diverse backgrounds and academic goals. In addition to its outstanding beauty, the campus benefits from its strategic location near Silicon Valley and the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, offering students numerous opportunities for research and internships. The campus has won many awards for its sustainability programs, including recognition from Sierra Magazine, recognition for its innovative dining hall programs, and LEED-certified \"Gold\" buildings.

the model of the New American University - a university that measures itself by whom it includes and how they succeed; advances research and discovery of public value; and assumes fundamental responsibility for the economic, social, cultural and overall health of the communities it serves. ASU champions intellectual and cultural diversity. Its research is use-inspired, breaking the boundaries that traditionally separate academic disciplines. ASU has been named the #1 school in the country for innovation by U.S. News & World Report for the last six years, ahead of Stanford and MIT, and the #2 U.S. public university chosen by international students by the Institute of International Education.ASU offers hundreds of undergraduate and graduate degree programs that offer abundant research opportunities and promote a multidisciplinary culture. Students pursue a wide range of majors on ASU's four campus locations including business, liberal arts, design, engineering, health, education, law, sustainability and the sciences. Students looking for an experience focused on academic rigor can join ASU's Barrett, The Honors College. This living-learning community offers students exclusive research, study abroad and internship opportunities, and is called the \"gold standard\" of the nation's honors colleges by The New York Times. Students can also customize the way they learn, choosing 7.5- or 15-week semesters, obtaining concurrent degrees or pursuing a master's degree while earning an undergraduate degree. Innovation and entrepreneurship are emphasized at ASU -- here, enterprising students can learn skills such as how to start a business or bring a new product to market with the full guidance and support of the university. At ASU, students are treated as design partners. The university gives them the tools to contribute to and even lead some of ASU's most important discoveries and projects, such as the Student Pavilion on the Tempe campus. Students helped design the building and now manage and operate it as headquarters for student clubs, organizations and events. The Sun Devil Fitness Complex welcomes students to take a break from their studies and focus on their health, while the Sun Devil Athletics facilities, performing arts venues (including the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed ASU Gammage) and unique campus locations complement this diverse university environment.Each ASU college and school, as well as every department and office, is committed to adopting innovative programs and creating new solutions to support each student's success. As an example, during the 2020-2021 academic year, ASU adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure that students could safely continue on their degree path uninterrupted. Among other innovations, the university launched a health check app to help students monitor their personal health. ASU's Biodesign Institute developed and launched an FDA approved saliva-based COVID-19 rapid test that continues to be used, statewide. And, thanks to longstanding investments in classroom-enabled technology, all campus-based students, including more than 3,000 international students who could not travel to the U.S., were able to stay enrolled by remotely joining classmates in synchronous live streams of classes held on campus.", "totalUndergrads": 63124, "totalGradsAndPros": 11671, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 50, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 50}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 2.8, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 19, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 81}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", ""], ["sorority housing", ""], ["fraternity housing", ""], ["apartment for single students", ""], ["special housing for disabled students", ""], ["other housing options", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 8, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 92}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 10, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 90}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Offered on campus", "csAvgCost": 11706, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 7044, "nptMed1": 8921, "nptMed2": 14033, "nptHi1": 17373, "nptHi2": 18583}, "netPriceCalculator": "https://students.asu.edu/financialaid/net-price", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 20278, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 9148, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 13884, "mdIncDebtMdn": 14375, "hiIncDebtMdn": 13750}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 193, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 24488, "pctIncuredDebt": 45, "vGiBill": 4, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 34, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 2009, "regAlcPermYesno": "No", "vGuiServAva": ["co-op education", "on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "placement service", "day care", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Art, Anthropology, Geology, History, and Sports Museums; Herbarium; Biodesign Institute; Global Institute of Sustainability; Arboretum; Gammage; Decision Theater; Gallery of Design; Digital Imaging Lab; planetarium; galleries; collections; research labs; Life Science Center; Artlink A.E.

The university's eleven degree granting units offer undergraduate and graduate programs in areas such as engineering, computing, information technology, engineering technology, business, hospitality, science, art, design, photography, biomedical sciences, game design and development, and the liberal arts including psychology, advertising and public relations, and public policy.  Experiential learning  has been a hallmark of an RIT education since 1912.  Every academic program at RIT offers some form of experiential education opportunity which may include cooperative education, internships, study abroad, and undergraduate research. Distinctive academic offerings include microelectronic and software engineering, imaging science, film and animation, biotechnology, physician assistant, new media, international business, packaging science, telecommunications, and the programs in the School for American Crafts.   In addition, students may choose from more than ninety different minors to develop personal and professional interests that complement their academic program. Students work hard, but learning is complemented with plenty of organized and spontaneous events and activities.  RIT is a unique blend of rigor and fun, creativity and specialization, intellect and practice that prepares alumni for long-term career success in global society.", "totalUndergrads": 13412,

With a commitment to undergraduate education, UVM professors -- world-class researchers, scholars, and artists -- bring their discoveries into the classroom and their students into the field. You'll find UVM students across all levels of education studying the effects of climate change aboard the Melosira, a research vessel and floating lab; testing new vaccines at the on-campus medical center; launching local start-ups; and working with refugees at Burlington community centers.The fifth oldest university in New England, UVM boasts a legacy of important firsts in education: the first college to declare public support of freedom of religion and the first to admit women and African-Americans to Phi Beta Kappa.

This mission is expressed through:*\tA rigorous, student-centered and interdisciplinary approach to education. *\tA supportive, inclusive, diverse, and empowering community.*\tMaking the most of the unique entrepreneurial attributes of Southern California.The University offers over 100 areas of study, including a top 10 ranked film school, undergraduate business program, law school and teaching program. Chapman reached R2 status in the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, indicating the university's growth in research (particularly undergraduate student/faculty research), doctoral and professional practice degree programs. The Chapman campus continues to grow, with the opening of the Keck Center for Science and Engineering, a 140,000-square-foot cutting-edge space for learning, research and collaboration. Film students benefit from a 76,000-square-foot, state-of-the-art facility designed to replicate a professional production studio. Students and faculty at the new Brain Institute, engage in interdisciplinary study, asking the big questions like, \"Do we have free will?\" And the newly named Dale E. and Sarah Ann Fowler School of Engineering welcomed its first incoming class in Fall of 2019.  Undergraduates across the campus benefit from a wide variety of interdisciplinary courses, including dynamic pairings of majors and minors throughout the schools. In this way, students learn how issues facing the nation and the world today are interconnected and require the perspectives of multiple disciplines.Chapman students benefit from learning in small classes, averaging 23 students. And with a faculty to student ratio of 13:1, they enjoy the personal attention of caring and distinguished faculty. Students have the opportunity to study abroad for a semester, to engage in international internships, and to participate in full-time faculty led short-term travel courses around the world. Chapman students come to Southern California from 48 states and 69 countries, and 83% of students find full-time employment or are continuing their education in the first year after graduation. With an alumni network of more than 50,000 worldwide, Chapman graduates join a large cohort of active citizens and industry professionals making an impact, inventing new technologies and solving problems locally, nationally and throughout the global community.", "totalUndergrads": 7404, "totalGradsAndPros": 2357, "pctPell": 19, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 39, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 61}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 1.1, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 11, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 89}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", ""], ["apartments for married students", ""], ["apartment for single students", ""], ["other housing options", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 20, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 80}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 27, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 73}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered at cooperating institution", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered at cooperating institution", "vRotcOffNavy": "Not offered", "csAvgCost": 41350, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 33219, "nptMed1": 31826, "nptMed2": 36041, "nptHi1": 37848, "nptHi2": 48771}, "netPriceCalculator": "http://www.chapman.edu/finaid/", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 20750, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 9500, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 19000, "mdIncDebtMdn": 19469, "hiIncDebtMdn": 18000}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 198, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 48, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 90, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Student patrols", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Hilbert Museum; Leatherby Libraries; Guggenheim Art Gallery; Berlin Wall and Liberty Plaza; Partridge Center for Dance; Oliphant Hall; Fish Interfaith Center and Wallace All Faiths Chapel; Entertainment Technology Center; Theater Production Warehouse; Marion Knott Studios; Attallah Piazza; Z.

Illinois Tech is the only tech-focused university in Chicago and is home to more than 6,700 students from 93 countries and 49 states enrolled in undergraduate and graduate degree programs in engineering, the sciences, architecture, human sciences, design, business, applied technology, and law. Illinois Tech's Mies Campus, located three miles from downtown Chicago and adjacent to Guaranteed Rate Field, home of the Chicago White Sox, was named by Forbes as one of the country's most beautiful college campuses. Nineteen of its buildings, including the iconic S. R. Crown Hall, were designed by the legendary architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and architects Helmut Jahn and Rem Koolhaas, respectively, designed the contemporary State Street Village residence hall and The McCormick Tribune Campus Center; the latter incorporated elevated train tracks into its design. Our technology-focused curriculum, and specifically our signature Interprofessional Projects (IPRO) Program, is distinctive in that it focuses on active, applied learning. Each semester-long IPRO course is a team-based project in which students from various majors work together to find solutions to real-world problems, such as developing a system for clean drinking water for the world's rural poor and developing a robotic standing wheelchair with a supinating arm. Innovative thinking is always taking place at Illinois Tech, especially in the Idea Shop. This 13,000-square-foot facility with rapid-prototyping equipment, 3-D printers, tools for app development, a laser cutter, and other cutting-edge equipment helps students turn ideas into reality. The Kaplan Institute is a new building on campus that has major impact on undergraduate and graduate education by housing facilities and equipment for implementing novel, educational, and entrepreneurial strategies. Two $1 million-plus Nayar Prize awards were established to encourage breakthrough projects that will produce meaningful results with a societal impact. We are a member of the NCAA Division III; varsity athletes compete on men's and women's teams in basketball, cross country, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, track and field, lacrosse, volleyball, and men's baseball. Illinois Tech offers intramural sports, special leadership programs, and more than 150 student organizations. The university is home to more than two-dozen research centers, including the Pritzker Institute of Biomedical Science and Engineering and the Wanger Institute for Sustainable Energy Research. A signature research initiative is the campus-wide Illinois Tech Microgrid, which is designed to eliminate costly outages, minimize power disturbances, and curb greenhouse gas emissions; it is the nation's first functional microgrid. Undergraduates have the opportunity to work alongside faculty and researchers both on campus and at national laboratories. Innovations including the cell phone, magnetic recording, tall building architecture, and bar code technology are associated with Illinois Tech faculty and alumni. The hallmark of an Illinois tech education is high opportunity and high value, with graduates earning the highest mid-career salaries in Illinois (PayScale). Our co-terminal degree programs allow students to earn both bachelor's and master's degrees in as few as five years. More than 98 percent of our students receive some type of financial aid. A 2017 report from the Equality of Opportunity Project showed that Illinois Tech surpasses all other Illinois universities profiled when it comes to the earnings of our graduates from low-income households.", "totalUndergrads": 3123, "totalGradsAndPros": 3203, "pctPell": 30, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 68, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 32}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 1.8,

In addition to these excellent and nationally-recognized programs, Mizzou offers more than 300 degree programs from 12 schools and colleges. Thanks to Mizzou's focus on research, scholarships, and world-renowned faculty, it is one of only 36 public U.S. universities to be a member of the prestigious Association of American Universities (AAU). Alongside this honor, Mizzou has been thrilled to enroll students from not only every county in Missouri, but all 50 states and more than 100 countries around the world. All of those students are drawn by a few key factors, not the least of which is Columbia, Missouri. Situated halfway between Kansas City and St. Louis, Columbia is a thriving community with a vibrant downtown scene full of great restaurants, live music, shopping, and art galleries, all just a few steps away from Mizzou's campus. The other big draw for students, and one Mizzou is incredibly proud of, is the Missouri Method. First honed at the J-School (the first School of Journalism established anywhere in the world), the Missouri Method of hands-on learning sets Mizzou apart from other universities. Journalism students broadcast the news themselves at the only university-owned commercial news station in the country. Medical students will advise and help to rehabilitate real patients in one of several university-run clinics. Engineering students will submit projects for national competitions. Business students will pitch businesses and hone entrepreneurial skills. All Mizzou students have opportunities to consult on academic research papers, publish music, and hold patents. This focus on the Missouri Method and career-ready experience is why more than 7,500 employers recruit from Mizzou each year. These experiences aren't limited to Mizzou's classrooms and campus, either. Mizzou offers incredible study abroad programs all over the world, as well as the country's largest alternative breaks program, wherein students spend their semester breaks in service to communities across the country and the world. A final draw comes from the sense of community and belonging at Mizzou. With more than 600 recognized student organizations on campus, any student will be able to find their place at Mizzou.", "totalUndergrads": 23396, "totalGradsAndPros": 7707, "pctPell": 22, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 46, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 54}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 1.2, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 30, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 70}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", ""], ["women's dorms", ""], ["men's dorms", ""], ["sorority housing", ""], ["fraternity housing", ""], ["apartments for married students", ""], ["apartment for single students", ""], ["theme housing", ""], ["other housing options", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 24, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 76}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 30, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 70}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Offered on campus", "csAvgCost": 16001, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 10940, "nptMed1": 11595, "nptMed2": 13145, "nptHi1": 19595, "nptHi2": 22868}, "netPriceCalculator": "http://financialaid.missouri.edu/cost-of-attendance/net-price-calculator.php", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 21500, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 9500, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 17500, "mdIncDebtMdn": 19000, "hiIncDebtMdn": 18000}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 205, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 28457, "pctIncuredDebt": 52, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 38, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 1262, "vGuiServAva": ["on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "women's center", "placement service", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Bingham Gallery;

Partnerships throughout Chicago enable DePaul to provide an exceptional educational experience that is vibrant, pragmatic and socially engaged. Nearly half of all our undergraduates complete at least one internship before graduation, putting us among the top 10 universities nationally in providing such experience. DePaul meshes seamlessly with Chicago's commercial and artistic communities, offering students unparalleled access to internships and learning opportunities with many of the nation's top corporations and organizations as well as a rich array of cultural events and institutions. An example is DePaul's partnership with Cinespace Chicago to provide students with film and television production experience in the midst of the city's premier movie studio.  Our Steans Center, one of a handful of endowed service-learning programs in the nation, coordinates courses that teach students while simultaneously helping more than 400 organizations throughout the metropolitan area. Students tap such connections for internships, mentors, class projects, professional contacts, and more. DePaul is one of 62 universities nationwide, and the only one in Illinois, to qualify for the Community Engagement citation given by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. DePaul is the nation's largest Catholic university, with nearly 22,000 students, and more than 300-degree programs, yet students easily forge personal connections. Many faculty members are nationally recognized in their field, yet they are accessible and approachable, taking an active interest in our students' aspirations. More than 97 percent of classes are taught by faculty members, not teaching assistants, while about 90 percent of classes have 40 or fewer students. All full-time faculty members teach, and those who teach graduate students also teach undergraduates. Founded in 1898 by the Congregation of the Mission (Vincentians), DePaul's tradition of providing quality education to students from a broad range of backgrounds, with particular attention to first-generation students, has resulted in one of the nation's most diverse student bodies. This wide range of backgrounds and perspectives enables students to learn from each other through our discussion- and project-oriented approach. Students admitted under DePaul's test-optional policy succeed at similar rates to students who submit the ACT or SAT. DePaul has more than 180,000 living alumni, with the majority residing in the Chicago metropolitan area, providing students with a network locally and around the world.", "totalUndergrads": 14145, "totalGradsAndPros": 7777, "pctPell": 30, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 47, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 53}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 1.6, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 1, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 99}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", ""], ["apartment for single students", ""], ["special housing for disabled students", ""], ["special housing for international students", ""], ["theme housing", ""], ["wellness housing", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 5, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 95}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 8, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 92}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Not offered", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Not offered", "csAvgCost": 30090, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 26173, "nptMed1": 25842, "nptMed2": 28075, "nptHi1": 30877, "nptHi2": 35041}, "netPriceCalculator": "https://www.collegenpc.com/DePaulUniversity", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 24144, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 10500, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 21500, "mdIncDebtMdn": 20000, "hiIncDebtMdn": 19000}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 230, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 30330, "pctIncuredDebt": 65, "vGiBill": 2, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 54, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 41, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "women's center", "placement service", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "LEED-certified environmental science and chemistry building with greenhouse and green roof, digital cinema laboratory with motion-capture system, green-screen studio, converged newsroom, 10 specialized computer research labs including artificial intelligence, biomedics informatics and mobile e-commerce, 1,300-seat theatre, art museum, and a fitness and recreational center with pool", "vProServAva": ["reading machines", "note-taking services", "oral tests", "readers", "extended time for tests", "tutors", "priority registration", "priority seating", "proofreading services", "typist/scribe", "exams on tape or computer", "other testing accommodations"], "vGuiSpePgm": ["note-taking services", "tape recorders", "special housing", "tutors", "adaptive equipment", "reader services", "braille services", "interpreters for hearing-impaired", "talking books"], "guidnceCmpsAcsblty": "Mostly"}, {"primaryKey": "1443", "xwalkId": "131450", "urlName": "gallaudet-university", "displayName": "Gallaudet University", "shortName": "Gallaudet University", "city": "Washington", "state": "DC", "zip": "20002", "website": "http://www.gallaudet.edu", "streetAddress1": "800 Florida Avenue NE", "streetAddress2": null, "phone": "(202) 651-5000", "institutionalControl": "private", "privateTuition": ["$17,112", "(2021-22)"], "inStateTuition": "N/A", "outStateTuition": "N/A", "roomAndBoard": ["$14,500", "(2021-22)"], "enrollment": ["1,019", "(fall 2020)"], "latitude": 38.9024, "longitude": -76.992, "applicationDeadline": "rolling", "usnews_category": "2", "ranks": {"national-universities_overall": "#127", "national-universities_best-value": "#12", "national-universities_social-mobility": "#21"}, "topMajors": [], "cSelectClass": "Less selective", "rCAcceptRate": 63, "gClassSizes": {"vClasses1": 99, "vClasses2": 1, "vClasses3": 0}, "vStudentFacultyRatio": "6:1", "gradRate4Year": 19, "gStudentGenderDistribution": {"vPctUnderMen": 45, "vPctUnderWomen": 55}, "totalAllStudents": 1451, "association": "NCAA III", "g_financial_aid_statistics": {"pctApplyFinAid": 92.9, "pctNeedFullyMet": 25.9, "pctRecvAidFt": 87, "pctSelfHelpFt": 41.4, "avgPctNeedMetFt": 41}, "vPrivateTuition": 17112, "wRoomBoard": 14500, "guiAddServIns": "Yes", "schoolStatementText": "Gallaudet University has moved to online instruction for its students and remote work for its employees.

merely in, but of its environment. A part of Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, it is located in the great city of Newark, the state's largest city and cultural capital, where the great challenges facing our increasingly metropolitan nation and world can be found, as can the assets needed to take on those challenges. The Rutgers-Newark community takes very seriously the urgent call to higher education today to prepare students for the world as it will be; produce scholarship that makes a difference in our city, state, nation, and world; increase access and affordability for increasingly diverse generations of students; fully recognize and reward faculty and staff for the full range of their roles; and get higher education out of its silo through collaborations locally and globally, while breaking down silos within. The university's location is both a defining influence in its story and a distinctive strength, especially as it serves to attract talent: generations of students hungry for the opportunities afforded by gaining a first-rate higher education in a major American urban center; faculty who vigorously embrace the opportunity to produce high impact scholarship, engage the community, and prepare these students for professional success and informed citizenship in an increasingly complex world; and staff committed to advancing an inclusive campus culture focused on excellence. Rutgers--Newark's roots date back to 1908, when the New Jersey Law School first opened its doors. That law school, along with four other educational institutions in Newark (Dana College, the Newark Institute of Arts & Sciences, the Seth Boyden School of Business, and the Mercer Beasley School of Law), formed a series of alliances over the years. A final merger in 1936 resulted in the establishment of the University of Newark. A decade later, Rutgers University in Newark was founded when the New Jersey State Legislature voted to make the University of Newark part of Rutgers University.  That conglomeration of small institutions is now Rutgers University-Newark, a world-class urban research and teaching institution which, since 1997, has been rated as one of the most diverse national campuses by U.S. News & World Report.", "totalUndergrads": 9118, "totalGradsAndPros": 4113, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 44, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 56},

Home to nearly 10,000 undergraduate and graduate students and offering more than 90 rigorous academic programs, Seton Hall's academic excellence has been singled out for distinction by The Princeton Review, U.S. News & World Report and Bloomberg Businessweek. Seton Hall embraces students of all religions and prepares them to be exemplary servant leaders and global citizens. The University is also proud to be among the most diverse national Catholic universities in the country. In recent years, the University has achieved extraordinary success. Since 2009, it has seen record-breaking undergraduate enrollment growth and an impressive 110-point increase in the average SAT scores of incoming freshmen. In the past decade, Seton Hall students and alumni have received more than 30 Fulbright Scholarships as well as other prestigious academic honors, including Boren Awards, Pickering Fellowships, Udall Scholarships and a Rhodes Scholarship. In the past five years, Seton Hall launched a School of Medicine as well as a College of Communication and the Arts. It also opened the Buccino Leadership Institute, offering one-of-a-kind leadership instruction to undergraduates from all disciplines. The University's beautiful main campus in suburban South Orange, N.J. is only 14 miles from New York City -- offering students a wealth of employment, internship, cultural and entertainment opportunities. Seton Hall's nationally recognized School of Law is located prominently in downtown Newark.

Private and coeducational, Catholic University has 12 schools. Ten schools award undergraduate degrees: architecture and planning, arts and sciences, business and economics, engineering, music, nursing, philosophy, professional studies, social work, and theology and religious studies. All 12 schools grant graduate degrees. The student body of Catholic University totals nearly 6,500; of those nearly 3,500 are undergraduates. The University was founded in 1887 as a graduate institution. That foundation offers undergraduates unique opportunities to conduct scholarly and scientific research in their fields of study, working closely with faculty. Catholic University undergraduates begin their academic career with the First-Year Experience, which introduces them to philosophy, theology, rhetoric, and logic through study in small, supportive learning communities. This coursework engages them in thinking about, discussing, and writing about the great questions that have shaped human history and that continue to confront us today. Students have unique opportunities to address those questions worldwide through Catholic University's education abroad programs. Students in all majors can find semester, yearlong, or summer-only opportunities for study on five continents. In September 2015, the Rome Center of The Catholic University of America and Australian Catholic University opened, offering newly renovated living quarters for undergraduates, a wing for graduate students, apartments for visiting faculty, a studio for architecture majors, a chapel, and a garden, among other amenities. Politics majors can choose internships in the British or Irish houses of parliament, or the European Parliament or Commission. Architecture students can study the marvelous buildings of Rome or Paris, or, in the award-winning Spirit of Place Spirit of Design course, engage in a design-build project that begins in the studio and ends building a project in remote locations in such countries as Peru, Ireland, and Finland. Students in engineering can fulfill some of their academic requirements at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Nursing majors can learn valuable intercultural lessons at Australian Catholic University as well as take part in mission trips to Central America over the summer and on spring break. Through Campus Ministry, Catholic University students also embark on mission trips to Central America and Jamaica. In the nation's capital they serve poor, elderly, homeless, or otherwise disadvantaged people through homeless food runs, work with Little Sisters of the Poor at the Jeanne Jugan Residence across the street, and at So Others Might Eat. The long history of the University in Washington, D.C., offers Catholic University students an incredible range of cultural and professional opportunities, most accessible from the D.C. Metrorail system, which is adjacent to campus. In fact, students at the University have the best of both worlds: They study and live on 176 acres, the largest campus in D.C., where they can enjoy a complete collegiate experience. They also are located in the heart of the United States capital, a 9-minute Metrorail ride from Capitol Hill, the Smithsonian Institution, Supreme Court, Library of Congress, and Union Station.

Drake offers an intimate, personable experience in Des Moines, Iowa, combining the toughest academic standards with individual interests and professional determination to groom the leaders of tomorrow, encouraging students to explore multiple interests to become well-rounded individuals. The Drake experience is distinguished by collaborative learning and by the integration of the liberal arts and sciences with professional preparation. With a total student body around 5,000, Drake offers many of the benefits of a public university with the intimacy and tailored experience of a private institution. With a 10:1 student-to-faculty ratio, professors know students by name and their passions by heart. Through mentoring and collaboration, faculty and staff help students meet educational, professional, and personal goals. Drake Bulldogs hail from 49 states and 26 countries. Undergraduate students can choose from more than 100 rigorous programs of study, combine majors, or create their own major. Drake also offers graduate study in law, pharmacy, business, communication leadership, education, and more, bringing the University recognition as one of the nation's top institutions. Des Moines is a national hub for financial services, insurance, publishing, and politics; the nexus of Iowa's state government; the headquarters of industry giants; and the front-row seat of democracy every four years during Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses (Drake hosted a nationally televised Democratic debate and more than 50 campaign events in 2019-2020). Drake students gain real-world experience that prepares them for lifelong success: More than 92% of Drake students take part in at least one internship, practicum, or field experience before graduation. In addition, students benefit from a central Iowa alumni network of more than 19,000 Drake graduates--many of whom lead businesses and are eager to hire Drake students. Iowa's capital city also offers plenty of options for entertainment and play. Drake is also focused on service-learning and making our local, national, and international communities stronger. Each year students contribute more than 295,000 hours of service, amounting to $7 million in value to our community. A rigorous education plus meaningful local and global experience translates into real-world success: More than 98 percent of all Drake bachelor's degree recipients find career employment or enter graduate school within six months of receiving their degrees. College isn't just about studying--it's also about exploring new interests, making lifelong friends, and discovering individual paths. Drake's 150 student organizations are designed around a variety of interests, and its 15 national fraternities and sororities and more than 25 intramural and club sports provide further ways to be immersed in the Drake experience. Bulldog athletic teams compete in the NCAA Division I as members of the Missouri Valley Conference. The University also hosts the Drake Relays, a track-and-field meet that draws more than 40,000 spectators annually and features many of the world's best athletes. Drake is committed to ensuring that its students--and their families'--investments provide valuable returns throughout their lives. 100% of Drake's full time undergraduate students receive scholarships, making the actual cost of a Drake education competitive with public universities for many students. With proper planning, most students complete their degrees in just four years and begin working in their chosen profession after graduation. The Drake alumni network extends across the world, from graduates teaching English in China to the very top ranks of Fortune 500 companies.

The result is a Simmons graduate prepared not only to work, but to lead in professional, civic, and personal life -- a vision of empowerment that Simmons calls preparation for life's work.Simmons students value the small classes, exceptional internship opportunities, and individual attention from faculty who are experts as well as practitioners. Students balance academic life with campus group events and activities, sports, service projects, cultural events, campus traditions, and engaging with the greater Boston community. Simmons' independent learning requirement ensures that students benefit from hands-on experience and professional contacts through internships, fieldwork, and independent projects. Simmons also offers lifelong career services, exceptional alumnae mentoring programs, and an extensive alumnae network.Since its founding in 1899, Simmons has remained true to its proud history of

"uniQuaPerAcaYear": "The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is ranked in the top tier of national universities, a member of the Big Ten Conference and the flagship university for the state of Nebraska. We believe in the power of every person. We don't rest on our strengths - we stretch them. Sweat them. Combine them. Growing flexible, nimble and strong minds. Because that's what it takes to do big things. This past year, the university set a new record of $320M in total research expenditures across the campus. Nebraska is leading the way in fields such as food and water security, early childhood development and nanoscience. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, the intellectual property and commercialization units of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and the University of Nebraska Medical Center together were named in the top 100 entities globally for U.S. patents. In fall 2020, the university bucked national trends of double-digit declining enrollment and saw more Nebraskans, more national students, more first-generation students, and a record number of underrepresented minority students matriculate at UNL. The university was named a top producer for student Fulbright awards in 2021 and has initiated several programs to help give first-generation students tools for success, including First Huskers and First-Generation Nebraska, and has earned national recognition in the inaugural cohort of First Forward Institutions. Nebraska ranks among the best universities for veteran and military student success in the U.S. A significant step to increasing access at Nebraska is the Husker Scholars Program, enabled by $5 million in annual scholarship support from Nebraska Athletics for students not competing in intercollegiate athletics. Husker Scholars is providing support to more than 3,000 students. Nebraska faculty and staff are dedicated to helping students get the most out of college and get the preparation they need for a career or graduate school. For example, through one of the nation's leading undergraduate research programs - one that is backed by more than one million dollars in annual funding - Nebraska students work directly with faculty on research that creates new knowledge. UNL not only provides a tremendous high-value Big Ten education, due to our commitment to keeping tuition and fees as low as possible, our students also graduate with one-third less student debt than the national average. Nebraska celebrated its largest ever graduating class in May 2021 and last year reported its largest one-year jump in its six-year graduation rate. The university is located in the heart of Nebraska's capital, with a population of nearly 300,000. Lincoln is the ultimate college city: a major concert venue is five blocks from campus, costs for everything from food to entertainment are low, people are Midwestern-friendly, and the community ranks highly for safety.", "totalUndergrads": 20286, "totalGradsAndPros": 4822, "pctPell": 18, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 52, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 48},

Regardless of your studies and interests, you will transform from a student to an engaged member of society and more.

Ninety-five percent of graduates are employed or enrolled in graduate school within a year of graduation. You'll have access to a variety of scholarship opportunities with 97% of first-year students receiving a St. Thomas scholarship.

We embody our beliefs and they anchor our commitment to create a diverse, equitable and inclusive environment for all.

After a campus visit with engineering students and faculty, their assurances that he could pursue his interest in clean energy changed his mind. What Smith and other undergraduates discovered is that The University of Tulsa (TU) -- a private, inclusive university with an 10-to-1 student-faculty ratio -- is remarkable at matching students' dreams with a rock-solid academic foundation. TU offers more than 45 undergraduate majors through the College of Engineering & Natural Sciences, Kendall College of Arts & Sciences, Collins College of Business and Oxley College of Health Sciences. Students are encouraged to follow their academic curiosity, which can lead to multiple majors, minors and interdisciplinary majors within or between colleges, and still complete their studies in four years. Student-designed areas of academic concentration are also available, as are combined bachelor's/master's degree programs. TU students are rigorously challenged through coursework as well as independent scholarship and research, including the Tulsa Undergraduate Research Challenge, which engages qualified students in mentored research, concentrated study and service learning as early as freshman year. Our Global Scholars program engages students in global issues from the perspective of their particular major. Students take a set of classes that explore the big questions affecting the world and participate in monthly programming on campus followed by international study, research or internship. Several initiatives provide hands-on experience for students who provide useful products and ideas locally and globally. Make A Difference Engineering (MADE@TU) engages students in producing durable equipment for Tulsa-aera residents with physical or developmental disabilities. The School of Art's Third Floor Design provides pro bono graphic design material for local nonprofits, while speech pathology students, under faculty supervision, provide assessment and therapy services for a variety of disorders. TU's Sustainable Engineering for Needy and Emerging Areas club provides humanitarian work for communities and families around the world. Academic resources available to undergraduates include McFarlin Library's internationally renowned collection of American, British and Irish literary documents as well as Native American historical documents; a partnership with Gilcrease Museum, one of the best institutions for the study of American and Native American art and history; an active undergraduate entrepreneurial program that gives students the skills and experience to set them apart as future business leaders; and access to cutting-edge technology and instrumentation, including scanning electron microscopes, a microarray core facility and the world's largest research flow loop. Undergraduates interested in science, technology or engineering benefit from TU's designation as a Center of Excellence in Information Assurance by the National Security Agency. TU is one of six pioneer institutions selected by the National Science Foundation for the Federal Cyber Service Initiative (Cyber Corps). Undergraduates finish TU with a deep understanding of their discipline, practical experience in applying knowledge to real-world situations and extracurricular activities that help them mature personally and professionally. Because of these unique educational attributes and experiences, TU students routinely win prestigious honors -- 66 Goldwater Scholarships, 71 National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowships, 25 Fulbright Grants, 12 Truman Scholarships, 9 Udall Scholarships, 5 British Marshall Scholarships, and, of course, Kirk Smith's Rhodes Scholarship (the third for TU).", "totalUndergrads": 2929,

Founded in 1885, Michigan Tech was established as a training ground for mining engineers, with founding legislation that called on the university to \"promote the welfare of the industries of the state.\" Over the decades, Michigan Tech evolved to keep pace with physical technologies--in mechanical engineering, forestry, computer science, and scientific and technical communication, to name a few--and expanded its focus to examine not just the technologies themselves, but their impact on society. Today, MTU offers more than 120 undergraduate and graduate degree programs in science and technology, forestry, computing, business, health professions, humanities, mathematics, and social sciences. Undergraduate students in the Enterprise Program work in teams with industry sponsors on real-world projects in the realms of homeland security, wireless communications, environmental sustainability, hybrid electric vehicles, and nanosatellites. College of Business students have won two Global Asset Management Education (GAME) Forums, and Michigan Tech was one of eight universities chosen to participate in the four-year AutoDrive Challenge, an autonomous vehicle competition hosted by GM and SAE International. Students, staff, and faculty participation in Engineers Without Borders, Habitat for Humanity, and Make A Difference Day, positively impacting communities both locally and globally. Michigan Tech's research expenditures exceed $77 million annually. University research is diverse, spanning from ion thrusters for NASA to computer modeling using gaming technologies to develop better biofuels to the world's longest-running predator-prey study--wolves and moose in Isle Royale National Park. Both undergraduate and graduate students participate in paid research. Students partner with the US Coast Guard and Air Force to design, test, and prototype a light, easy-to-deploy mass water rescue vessel. They build spacecraft rocketed to the International Space Station for deployment. They work with NASA to design lunar rovers. They develop low-cost modular infant incubators to help lower neonatal mortality rates in developing countries. And they launch crowdfunding programs to develop affordable HVAC systems that filter pathogens for cleaner, safer air in homes and offices. More than 400 companies and 2,000 recruiters attend Michigan Tech's two annual Career Fairs, and 93 percent of our students land a job, enter the military, or go on to graduate school within six months of graduation. Recreational activities include playing a round at MTU's 18-hole golf course; skiing or snowboarding at Mont Ripley, the university's ski hill; or exploring 600 acres of cross-country trails and recreational forests right on campus, all in the small-town atmosphere of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The university's annual Winter Carnival celebration features enormous snow statues designed and built by students, human dogsled races, ice bowling, and other ways to celebrate our snowy climate. Other annual celebrations include a Parade of Nations and an international food and music festival; Keweenaw Day, an afternoon on Lake Superior's shore; and Spring Fling, one last on-campus celebration before finals. Of more than 220 registered student organizations, the biggest game on campus is broomball, where students slide on the ice in sneakers or boots and hit a rubber ball with a duct-taped broom. Michigan Tech's Athletics Department houses 14 varsity sports including basketball, football, hockey, tennis, track and field, Nordic skiing, cross country, soccer, and volleyball. MTU student-athletes average higher GPAs than the student body as a whole. Located on the Keweenaw Peninsula, the Michigan Tech campus overlooks the Keweenaw Waterway and is just a few miles from Lake Superior.", "totalUndergrads": 5642, "totalGradsAndPros": 1233, "pctPell": 21, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 71, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 29}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 1.9, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 43, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 57}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", "78%"], ["sorority housing", "2%"], ["fraternity housing", "5%"], ["apartments for married students", ""], ["apartment for single students", "15%"], ["special housing for disabled students", ""], ["theme housing", ""], ["wellness housing", ""], ["other housing options", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 9, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 91}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 10, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 90}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Not offered", "csAvgCost": 16463, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 8295, "nptMed1": 9049, "nptMed2": 13720, "nptHi1": 17908, "nptHi2": 23334}, "netPriceCalculator": "http://www.mtu.edu/admissions/tuition/calculator/", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 25682, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 8750, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 18500, "mdIncDebtMdn": 19500, "hiIncDebtMdn": 19500}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 245, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 38190, "pctIncuredDebt": 67, "vGiBill": 1, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 54, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 925, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["co-op education", "on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "women's center", "placement service", "day care", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Student patrols", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "The A.E.

After decades of providing students with a comprehensive liberal arts curriculum through the Arts and Sciences, in 1981 Rutgers-Camden began to offer its first master's degree programs, in biology, English, and business administration. In 1989, the growing demand for business offerings led to the founding of the School of Business-Camden, the first business school in southern New Jersey to earn prestigious accreditation from the AACSB International. Rutgers-Camden achieved another academic first in 2007: launching the first doctoral program on its campus--and the very first of its kind in the nation--with the PhD degree in childhood studies. Today, Rutgers-Camden boasts two additional PhD degrees in computational biology and public affairs. The School of Business offers a four-year undergraduate business curriculum along with MBA, professional master's, and executive programs. Rutgers Law School, ranked highly and nationally, boasts a new and impressive facility complete with a state-of-the-art moot courtroom. In 2011, the School of Nursing became the newest academic unit at Rutgers-Camden, providing health care institutions throughout the region with high-caliber nursing professionals.  At the Rutgers--Camden campus, students will find the prestige and resources of Rutgers and all the vitality and opportunity of the metro Philadelphia region. As the Rutgers of South Jersey, Rutgers-Camden delivers the academic heft one would expect from a powerhouse public research university, while focusing that energy--in teaching, research, and civic engagement--within the greater Delaware Valley.  The work done on the Rutgers-Camden campus along the bustling Camden waterfront is felt far beyond.  Rutgers-Camden educates students for successful careers and productive citizenship, supports a faculty of sharp thinkers who turn new knowledge into creative solutions, and shares the expertise of the institution with partners--local and global--to improve individual lives and build stronger communities.", "totalUndergrads": 5502, "totalGradsAndPros": 1574, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist":

At Thomas Jefferson University, our approach is to intersect various fields of study to give students an education built for the 21st century, and the breadth and depth of understanding across disciplines that employers are seeking. Jefferson, home of the Sidney Kimmel Medical College and the Kanbar College of Design, Engineering and Commerce, is a national doctoral research university delivering high-impact professional education in 160 undergraduate and graduate programs to 7,800 students in architecture, business, design, engineering, fashion, health, humanities medicine, science and textiles. Jefferson is redefining the higher education value proposition with its award-winning Nexus Learning approach that is collaborative and active; global; integrated with industry; focused on research across disciplines to foster innovation and discovery; and technology-enhanced. Jefferson is preparing students for the future of work by ensuring that they gain the critical skills necessary for tomorrow's work place. Through our core curriculum, students develop the qualities necessary for personal and professional success - contextual understanding, initiative, curiosity, confidence, collaboration, empathy, ethical reflection, and global perspective. Students collaborate to develop the latest in \"smart\" textiles, create back-to-school products for Target, or develop new solutions for pressing healthcare concerns. Each spring, fashion and textile design students showcase their stunning designs at the Jefferson Annual Fashion Show, and all design students, including those in architecture, industrial design, graphic design and interior design, exhibit their capstone projects at the Innovators' Expo. The fall Nexus Maximus competition attracts hundreds of students from a wide range of disciplines, including from international universities, to tackle a major societal challenge during one fast-paced weekend. Imagine a campus where you instantly feel connected to the world: Where you work with visiting students from Bangladesh, China, India, Jamaica, South Africa and Spain. Where you have opportunities to study abroad, and travel to England, Japan, Australia, Israel or Italy. Where you can volunteer in Rwanda and Honduras, and help design a hospital in Malawi. Imagine being part of the Design Factory Global Network working with students from more than 20 countries solving real-world problems, or immersing yourself in global fashion design, international business, or studying within the UK health system. In an increasingly global academic ecosystem, Jefferson offers many opportunities to leverage our international partnerships and programs that benefit students and drive important academic, clinical and research innovations. We create unique student learning experiences to open up a world of possibilities for students. They see and solve problems through different lenses and develop skills that are extremely desirable by employers as they pursue their careers. That is the Jefferson difference. It's what \"redefines humanly possible\" and it's at the core of our students' success. In fact, our graduates boast a 95 percent job and graduate school success rate. Head men's basketball coach Herb Magee, known as the \"Shot Doc\" and one of the most successful NCAA Men's Basketball head coaches, was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2011. Student-athletes compete as the Jefferson Rams in 17 NCAA Division II men's and women's teams. Our campuses are incubators, tradition breakers and beautiful places to learn. We cross the city and the suburbs. From our vibrant Center City campus to our East Falls grounds and beyond, each location offers a unique learning environment to experience all that is Jefferson.", "totalUndergrads": 3783,

Included in the elite group of R1: Doctoral Universities - Highest Research Activity by the Carnegie Classification, it has a long history of producing leaders in public service, academics and business.Its 16 academic divisions include a major medical school and more than 120 areas of study, from business and engineering to creative writing and dentistry. Its offerings include the Sally McDonnell Barksdale Honors College, acclaimed for a blend of academic rigor, experiential learning and opportunities for community action; the Croft Institute for International Studies, which allows students to gain a global perspective; and the Center for Manufacturing Excellence, which incorporates coursework from the schools of Engineering, Accountancy and Business Administration into its curriculum. The John D. Bower School of Population Health, which opened in 2017, is among only three programs of its kind nationwide.The School of Law is a leader in the fields of air and space law and sports law, and the school publishes the student-edited, international Journal of Space Law and the Mississippi Sports Law Review. In the School of Pharmacy, nearly 100 percent of graduates pass the national licensure exam on their first try. All the degree programs in the Patterson School of Accountancy are ranked in the nation's Top 10 by Public Accounting Report. The university is among only a handful of institutions to house Language Flagship programs in both Chinese and Arabic, and its Department of Physics and Astronomy is a member of international collaborations pushing the frontiers of astrophysics, high-energy physics and studies of lightning and sound. The Blues Archives includes B.B. King's massive record collection, and the university operates Rowan Oak, home of William Faulkner, as a museum.Ole Miss was the state's first public university to shelter a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the nation's oldest and most prestigious honor society. Strong academic programs and a rich and varied campus life have helped Ole Miss graduate 27 Rhodes Scholars and 15 Truman Scholars. The campus is diverse: 44 percent come from out-of-state, with all 50 states and 86 countries represented, and 23 percent of all students are minorities.Recent campus improvements include several new residence halls, a major expansion that nearly doubled the size of its Student Union, and a new student recreation center and transportation hub. Ole Miss is home to 20 research and education centers, including the National Center for Justice and the Rule of Law, which provides training on investigating and prosecuting cybercrime; the National Center for Physical Acoustics, which is helping to quiet jet engines and use infrasound to detect tornadoes; and the National Center for Natural Products Research, where scientists work to develop new agricultural chemicals and drugs derived from plants and sea creatures to treat cancer, AIDS, fungal infections and more.The campus is consistently ranked among the nation's most beautiful, and the Grove, a 10-acre space at the heart of campus, has been hailed as the nation's No. 1 tailgating spot. The university is in Oxford, recognized as one of the nation's great college towns and a center for writers and other artists. Like Ole Miss, Oxford is modest in size but large in the opportunities itprovides residents, offering many of the advantages of a larger place in a friendly and calm environment.Applicants can take the SAT or the ACT. The university will not consider the writing section of either exam when evaluating students for admission, but certain specialty programs may request these scores.", "totalUndergrads": 16179, "totalGradsAndPros": 4835, "pctPell": 23, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 42, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 58}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 0.9, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 23, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 77}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", "47%"], ["women's dorms", "23%"], ["men's dorms", "19%"], ["apartment for single students", "10%"], ["special housing for international students", "1%"]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 35, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 65}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 45, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 55}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Offered on campus", "csAvgCost": 14016, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 9455, "nptMed1": 11566, "nptMed2": 17415, "nptHi1": 19539, "nptHi2": 20417}, "netPriceCalculator": "https://finaid.olemiss.edu/calculator/", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 19500, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 12636, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 16000, "mdIncDebtMdn": 14877, "hiIncDebtMdn": 15000}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 186, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 34013, "pctIncuredDebt": 47, "vGiBill": 2, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 36, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 3804, "regAlcPermYesno": "No", "vGuiServAva": ["co-op education", "on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["women's center", "health service"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Rowan Oak (home of William Faulkner), Walton-Young Historic House, Bailey Woods Trail, Seymour Lawrence Gallery of American Art, Millington-Barnard Collection of Scientific Instruments, David M.

10,500 students choose from approximately 165 undergraduate and 175 graduate programs in the liberal arts and sciences; education; health professions and human services; the Peter S. Kalikow School of Government, Public Policy and International Affairs; the Fred DeMatteis School of Engineering and Applied Science;  the Frank G. Zarb School of Business; the Lawrence Herbert School of Communication; and the Maurice A. Deane School of Law. Hofstra also offers nursing, physician assistant and medical programs at the Hofstra Northwell School of Nursing and Physician Assistant Studies, and Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell. Almost 100 dual-degree programs allow our students to complete an undergraduate and a graduate degree in less time than if each degree were pursued separately. Among them is a unique dual-degree program (in global business or global finance and economics) with Dongbei University of Finance and Economics (DUFE) that includes a six-week summer internship in China. Hofstra is the only university ever chosen to host U.S. presidential debates in three consecutive election cycles (2008, 2012, and 2016). At Hofstra, 92% of full-time faculty members hold the highest degree in their fields, and many have been recognized with Fulbright and Guggenheim Fellowships, National Science Foundation and National Endowment for the Humanities awards, and Emmy Awards. We offer small classes (student-faculty ratio of 13-to-1 and an average undergraduate class size of 21) taught by professors, not graduate assistants. At Hofstra, each student is assigned two academic advisors (a student affairs advisor and a professor in their major) to provide guidance from the first year through graduation and beyond. With an emphasis on experiential learning, we provide innovative technology and equipment on campus; access to internships and co-ops that provide paid work experience in engineering, computer science, and business; a student-managed investment fund; global study programs; and fellowships and field research programs. Hofstra offers educational, cocurricular, and cultural programs and community service initiatives that foster an awareness of local, national, and global issues and encourage students to be active citizens. Hofstra's 244-acre suburban campus is a nationally recognized arboretum with lush, green quads that bloom with thousands of tulips every spring. Our 117 buildings, including state-of-the-art facilities such as a converged newsroom and multimedia classroom; a digital anatomy and physiology lab; an academic trading room with 34 Bloomberg Professional terminals; a behavioral research in business lab; an Institute of Innovation and Entrepreneurship with a business incubator and maker space; a Cybersecurity Innovation and Research Center; six theaters; cell and tissue engineering, robotics, and big data labs; a rooftop observatory; and WRHU-88.7 FM, Radio Hofstra University, our top-ranked, award-winning, student-run station. The Hofstra libraries provide 24/7 online access. Hofstra is home to over 200 clubs and organizations, including 25 local and national sororities and fraternities; 35 residence halls; 18 eateries; 21 NCAA Division I sports; an Olympic-size swimming pool; and ultramodern athletic and fitness facilities. Hofstra fosters a community that is committed to sustainable practices through its Office of Sustainability, Sustainability Studies degree programs, and research efforts, including water refill stations, a student-run garden, and partnerships with local organizations to donate time, goods, and services annually.

In fulfilling this mission, the University supports undergraduate, graduate, and professional learning, as well as basic research and its application in service to others. Founded by Baptists in 1833, Mercer is an independent university that remains grounded in a tradition that embraces freedom of the mind and spirit, cherishes the equal worth of every individual, and commits to serving the needs of humankind. As a university committed to excellence and innovation, Mercer challenges members of its community to meet and exceed high standards in their teaching, learning, research, scholarship and service. With more than 9,000 students enrolled in 12 schools and colleges on campuses in Macon, Atlanta, Savannah and Columbus, Mercer has a strong presence in Georgia. However, its more than 85,000 alumni are making important contributions to their professions and communities around the world. Twelve Mercerians have served as governors, and four alumni have served as U.S. senators. While offering a breadth of programs found at much larger universities, Mercer maintains an intimate, student-focused culture more characteristic of smaller liberal arts colleges. In Georgia, the University operates the only private engineering school and one of only six law schools. It is one of only three universities in the state to hold membership in the Georgia Research Alliance and shelter a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. The Mercer Health Sciences Center includes the state's largest pharmacy school and oldest college of nursing, as well as one of only four medical schools in Georgia. In addition, Mercer has one of the more prominent university presses in the country and operates an engineering research center employing more than 250 scientists and engineers. Central to the Mercer experience is an education that uniquely prepares students to lead virtuous, meaningful, and responsible lives and encourages a thoughtful examination of ethical and moral choices. Service learning, leadership development, and community involvement are three common threads that join all of Mercer's academic programs and experiences. U.S. News & World Report ranks Mercer in the top tier of national universities, and in 2020 ranked it as one of the 35 best values in the country and among the top 50 in the nation for undergraduate teaching. The Princeton Review consistently ranks it in the top 15% of all colleges and universities in North America. Mercer is one of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching's most decorated institutions for community engagement. Among the University's signature programs is Mercer On Mission, a unique blend of study abroad and service-learning that provides life-changing experiences for students through academic instruction, research, cultural immersion, meaningful service, and spiritual reflection. Working alongside in-country partners, Mercer students and faculty are bringing water to villages in Africa; fitting amputees in Vietnam with low-cost prosthetic legs; alleviating mercury poisoning in Africa and South America; and delivering much-needed medical care in Cambodia. Mercer is equally committed to the student experience beyond the classroom. A wide variety of organizations, honorary and professional societies, and religious and special interest groups enhance the quality of campus life. Mercer is the only private university in the state to field an NCAA Division I athletics program. As a member of the historic Southern Conference, Mercer competes in men's baseball, basketball, cross-country, football, lacrosse, soccer, golf, and tennis, and women's basketball, cross-country, golf, beach volleyball, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, track and field, and volleyball.", "totalUndergrads": 4911, "totalGradsAndPros": 4095, "pctPell": 35, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 36, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 64}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 3.5, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 77, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 23}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", "25%"], ["women's dorms", "23%"], ["men's dorms", "20%"], ["sorority housing", "3%"], ["fraternity housing", "5%"], ["apartment for single students", "24%"]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 20, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 80}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 25, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 75}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Not offered", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Not offered", "csAvgCost": 21464, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 17437, "nptMed1": 19479, "nptMed2": 20012, "nptHi1": 23301, "nptHi2": 25391}, "netPriceCalculator": "https://mercer.studentaidcalculator.com/survey.aspx", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 25000, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 10857, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 22743, "mdIncDebtMdn": 21500, "hiIncDebtMdn": 17718}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 239, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 31769, "pctIncuredDebt": 58, "vGiBill": 3, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 57, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 150, "regAlcPermYesno": "No", "vGuiServAva": ["co-op education", "on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "placement service", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "The McCorkle Music Building contains two large ensemble rehearsal rooms with recording capacity, 6 practice rooms,  keyboard lab and a beautiful, intimate 200 seat recital hall; the Spearman C.

special distinction is found in our Hawaiian, Asian, and Pacific orientation and our unique location in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The setting and the diversity of our students and faculty foster unique advantages in the study of Asian and Pacific cultures, foreign languages, tropical agriculture, tropical medicine, ocean and marine sciences, astronomy, volcanology, and international business.Our unique geographical, cultural, and historical heritage suggests that the University of Hawaii at Manoa values and the responsibilities inherent in embracing those values include the following:A focus on developing an awareness of and sensitivity to diversity and commonality. The Manoa campus is culturally rich and complex, providing a perfect social setting for frequent interactions with persons fromcultures other than ones own. At Manoa we incorporate and celebrate intercultural experiences and understanding into our social and educational environments in a comprehensive fashion. Manoa is also a place where historic political, economic and social conflicts between Native Hawaiian people, settlers and working immigrants have contributed to the diverse perspectives, beliefs, values and even conceptual frameworks of our islands people. Growing out of the core Hawaiian value of aloha, an essential component of the Manoa Experience, are insights that both bond us and simultaneously express the variations that collectively enrich us.A focus on global awareness and local responsibility. These values are consistent with a uniquely Hawaiian place of learning. Hawaii is a place where the strength of identity is important to Native Hawaiian peoplestruggling to maintain traditional connections while establishing new global relationships. Their struggle for cultural distinction forms a significant part of the story of human history and change. Hawaii is also a placewhere the peoples from Asia, Europe, and the Pacific regions gathered, formed communities, and built lives together. The pluri-cultural children of Hawaii are global citizens, a true pan-ethnic population. Hence, we attempt to infuse our pedagogical, social, and cultural environments with a global perspective and with questions and issues of global significance. Moreover, engaging and acting upon local questions and issues during theireducational experience at Manoa engenders in students a sense of responsibility toward future generations.A focus on sustainability and renewability. These values are also a reflection of our unique Hawaiian cultural history, as voiced in the Hawaiian core value of malama i ka aina, malama i ke kai (caring for the land and sea that sustain us). The Hawaiian culture teaches us to see Manoa as part of an ahupuaa extending from mountaintop to ocean, emphasizing an ecosystem understanding of our home. Hawaiis unique geographical status as the most isolated, populated land mass on the planet makes it incumbent upon us to develop research, technologies, economy, and a way of life based on sustainability and renewability, as Polynesians did over thousands of years of voyaging, discovery and settlement.

The International Engineering Program, or IEP, offers an unparalleled experience for students looking to become global engineers. Students earn two degrees simultaneously: a B.S. in an engineering discipline and a B.A. in Chinese, French, German, Italian, Spanish, or Global Language Area Studies with a concentration in Japanese. We combine the power of a world-class engineering program, housed in the new $150 million Fascitelli Center for Advanced Engineering, with a year abroad to study the language and to experience a global internship, making IEP graduates among the most sought-after at the University.In addition, due to its proximity to RI's coastline, URI offers several distinct marine and environmental programs, including marine biology, marine affairs, ocean sciences, and ocean engineering, as well as highly sought after programs in nursing, pharmacy, and kinesiology. New programs in interdisciplinary neuroscience, data science, international studies and diplomacy, and sports media and communications are building upon the University's research and academic strengths and are quickly becoming high-demand areas of study. And, despite a slump in foreign language studies across the country, URI continues to see record-breaking enrollments in this area.A beautiful campus combining the best of historic tradition with

is a Catholic university open to students of all faiths. The University has three New York City campuses (i.e., Queens, Staten Island, and Manhattan); a campus in Rome, Italy; study abroad sites in Paris, France, and Limerick, Ireland; and a graduate center in Hauppauge, NY. The University offers more than 100 associate, bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree programs in the arts, business, education, law, pharmacy, and the natural and applied sciences. Students come to St. John's from 45 states and 121 countries, and benefit from programs and activities that reflect the University's Catholic and Vincentian mission. This focus on making a positive difference in the world is evident in distinctive offerings, such as the Ozanam Scholars Program, which partners undergraduates, faculty, and community leaders to address systemic poverty and injustice through research and service; Academic Service-Learning, in which students help those in need while gaining real-world experience; and the Catholic Scholars Program, a multidisciplinary community of Catholic leaders that integrates academics, faith, reason, and service. The University's academic lecture series brings leading scholars, artists, and thinkers to campus, enhancing intellectual life. St. John's students have ample opportunity to study abroad during their time at the University. First-year students can study abroad for as little as $600 through the Global Passport Program. Students can also live and learn in Rome, Paris, and Limerick through the University's extensive semester-long Global Studies offerings, which prepare them for success in today's international workplace. Finally, St. John's Plunge Program gives students the opportunity to make short trips into cities in the US, Europe, or the Americas to perform crucial service work where it is needed most. In addition to these advantages of life and learning at St. John's, students benefit from connections to an alumni network of more than 194,000 that opens doors. More than 80 percent of alumni live in the New York metropolitan area. St. John's is home to 17 Division I teams--the Red Storm--and competes in the BIG EAST Conference. St. John's athletes continue on to compete in the National Basketball Association, Women's National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, and the Professional Golf Association, and many become champions in the fields of science, medicine, law, business, education, and the arts.", "totalUndergrads": 15693, "totalGradsAndPros": 4450, "pctPell": 36, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 44, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 56}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 0.8, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 13, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 87}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", ""], ["apartment for single students", ""], ["special housing for disabled students", ""], ["theme housing", ""], ["other housing options", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 5, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 95}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 9, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 91}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Not offered", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Not offered", "csAvgCost": 27130, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 23927, "nptMed1": 25253, "nptMed2": 26661, "nptHi1": 29471, "nptHi2": 30889}, "netPriceCalculator": "https://www.stjohns.edu/admission/tuition-and-financial-aid/net-price-calculator", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 25417, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 9500, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 19000, "mdIncDebtMdn": 19250, "hiIncDebtMdn": 19500}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 243, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 30831, "pctIncuredDebt": 64, "vGiBill": 1, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 37, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 102, "regAlcPermYesno": "No", "vGuiServAva": ["on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "University Gallery; Media Center; Institute for Asian Studies; Health Education Resource Center; Center for Psychological Services; Instructional Television and Film Center; Speech and Hearing Center; University Writing Center; Financial Information Lab; Dr. Andrew J.

In addition, the University is deepening its institutional affiliation with Albany Law School, a 164-year-old private college. The association will provide a multitude of new opportunities for program renewal and innovative inquiry aimed at redefining how legal education will be delivered in the future.More than 600 study abroad programs, available through the University and SUNY networks, expand the worldview of students and prepare them for the global economy. The location of UAlbany in the Capital Region of New York provides extensive opportunities for internships and public service through which students gain valuable experience and contribute to the greater community.Both the UAlbany campus and the region are bustling with extracurricular activities.

with a distinguished history dating back to 1908m when it opened as a school to train teachers. Today the University has 10 colleges and schools that serve 21,000 undergraduate and graduate students with more than 300 doctoral, master's and baccalaureate programs. Situated on a beautiful, 252-acre suburban campus just 12 miles from New York City, Montclair State welcomes a very diverse population of students and delivers the instructional and research resources of a large public university in a supportive and sophisticated academic environment that has a feeling of community that is more typical of a smaller institution. Over the past 20 years, the University's enrollment has nearly doubled, and Montclair State has taken its place as one of New Jersey's largest and most successfully diverse institutions, while expanding its degree offerings and earning national and state recognition for the quality of its research and  teaching and its commitment to student success. In recent years, the University has created a number of important research centers and institutes, opened four new schools and colleges, and built or renovated 4 million square feet of academic space. The University has invested in the quality of the student experience in recent years, adding a new recreation center, attractive suite-style housing and a train station with direct service to Manhattan. Montclair State's student body reflects, in every way, the diversity of New Jersey and the society it serves. Coming from virtually every demographic and socioeconomic group, from big cities and small towns, students arrive on a campus where everyone feels included and welcomed. Montclair State gives its students a level of personal attention and support characteristic of smaller institutions, something not often found on large research university campuses. Students recognize and appreciate this culture and in return are incredibly loyal to their alma mater.Multiple campus activities and traditions enhance school spirit and enrich the student experience, including a very strong NCAA Division III athletic program, intramural and club sports; indoor and outdoor recreation programs; flag raisings and Homecoming; and a beloved mascot, Rocky the Red Hawk, who often roams the campus in a golf cart driven by one of his student helpers. The Center for Student Involvement organizes everything from Greek Life to Broadway trips and events that help assure that Montclair State's sizable commuter population is as well-engaged as its residential population. Students have multiple opportunities to expand their leadership skills, make new friends and experience college at its fullest through participation in more than 120 organizations, including student government, academic clubs, the student newspaper and radio station, and cultural, artistic, spiritual, political, issues-oriented, cultural and community service organizations. Montclair State provides a wide range of support services geared to helping students succeed academically. The recently created University College provides an academic home for pre-major (undeclared) students and expanded advising resources to help students stay on track academically and graduate in a timely fashion. The Academic Support Center provides a wide range of tutoring and skill-building programs, and Red Hawk Central is a  \"one-stop shop\" that makes it easy for busy students to access a wide range of support services without having to visit multiple offices. The Dean of Students Office, Center for Leadership and Engagement, Center for Student Involvement, Counseling and Psychological Services, Health Promotion, Social Justice and Diversity, University Health Center, the Red Hawk Food Pantry, Rocky's Closet and a community-focused University Police Department, are all designed to help students thrive.", "totalUndergrads": 16374, "totalGradsAndPros":

Rowan offers bachelor's through doctoral programs to nearly 20,000 students through its campuses in Glassboro, Camden and Stratford, New Jersey, and online. It is one of only three universities in the nation to grant both M.D. and D.O. medical degrees. Focused on practical research at the intersection of engineering, medicine, science and business, Rowan has earned national recognition for innovation, commitment to high-quality, affordable education, and developing public-private partnerships. The historic $100-million Rowan gift in 1992 put then-Glassboro State College on a fast track. At the time, the gift was the largest to a public institution in the U.S., and it fostered the creation of the College of Engineering and enabled ambitious growth.

community of scholars with a 130+ year tradition of serving the greater good. Talented students, dedicated faculty, and generations of loyal alumni pursue discoveries to make Washington a better place to live, learn, and work.WSU researchers target critical national and global problems. They team with scholars around the world--as well as with federal and state agencies, national laboratories, business and civic leaders, and philanthropists. Working across disciplines, they address Grand Challenges: sustaining health, sustainable resources (food, energy, and water), social opportunity and equity, smart systems, and national security. Their discoveries give rise to solutions. For instance, WSU research combining 3-D printing technology with drug delivery has yielded life-changing bone replacement therapy. WSU biofuels research led to the first flight of a commercial jet using renewable fuel made from logging residues. Discovery of a canine genetic mutation--and development of a simple cheek swab test to detect it--has likely prevented fatal drug reactions in hundreds of thousands of dogs worldwide. WSU's flavorful new apple variety, Cosmic Crisp(tm), debuted in grocery stores last year. Undergraduates at WSU choose from 200+ fields of study. They work alongside professors who include members of the National Academies, Fulbright Fellows, and some of the most cited researchers in the world. WSU faculty members have a well-deserved reputation for accessibility. They equip undergraduates to present and publish research findings. Students enjoy hands-on learning. For example, in the Edward R. Murrow College of Communication, broadcast journalism students produce a daily television newscast. Students in the organic agriculture major dig in on a 30-acre certified organic teaching farm. In the Carson College of Business, hospitality business management students study overseas to master cross-cultural communication and management principles. In every field, the Writing Program teaches undergraduates to write effectively, a vital skill in any career. The Honors College attracts top students from all majors. The curriculum immerses students in small, discussion-based courses and builds their understanding of issues in a global context. Seniors complete a thesis project exploring a topic in depth.  Graduate students from 92 nations enroll in WSU's nearly 150 master's, doctoral, and professional degree programs. A bedrock of health sciences offerings spans the colleges of medicine, nursing, pharmacy, and veterinary medicine. In 2015 the University established the Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine, which prepares physicians to serve Washington communities where they are needed most. WSU displays an unflagging dedication to sustainability. Faculty research addresses threats of energy supply, climate change, pollution, and resource depletion. New construction meets green building standards. Students give to a fund for campus sustainability projects. Students from all disciplines recognize the importance of civic engagement. Each year more than 10,500 share their time and talents to benefit the community. WSU strives to deepen students' understanding of diverse cultures and the responsibilities of global citizenship. 500+ study abroad programs take students to 70 countries. International students comprise 8 percent of the student body statewide, a share that WSU aims to increase. More than 31,000 students-- from every state and 117 countries --study at WSU campuses across the state. At the Pullman campus in southeastern Washington, Cougar spirit permeates life for nearly 20,000 enrollees. Loyal fans form a sea of crimson to cheer on the Cougs in Pac-12 sports. WSU also educates students at campuses in Vancouver, the Tri-Cities, Spokane, and Everett. Online learning programs serve students worldwide. In each of the state's 39 counties, Extension offices address local issues through research and outreach services.", "totalUndergrads": 25470, "totalGradsAndPros": 5689, "pctPell": 28, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 46, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 54}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 3.5, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 5, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 95}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", ""], ["women's dorms", ""], ["men's dorms", ""], ["sorority housing", ""], ["fraternity housing", ""], ["apartments for married students", ""], ["apartment for single students", ""], ["special housing for disabled students", ""], ["special housing for international students", ""], ["cooperative housing", ""], ["theme housing", ""], ["wellness housing", ""], ["other housing options", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 21, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 79}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 26, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 74}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Offered at cooperating institution", "csAvgCost": 16358, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 9334, "nptMed1": 11337, "nptMed2": 15548, "nptHi1": 22090, "nptHi2": 23961}, "netPriceCalculator": "https://forms.financialaid.wsu.edu/cost-of-attendanceaid-estimator/npc/", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 20000, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 9213, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 14750, "mdIncDebtMdn": 14750, "hiIncDebtMdn": 14250}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 191, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 26479, "pctIncuredDebt": 56, "vGiBill": 3, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 41, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 1742, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["co-op education", "on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "women's center", "placement service", "day care", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Student patrols", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Museums of art, natural history, anthropology, entomology, veterinary anatomy, geology;

The University boasts the heritage of two founding institutions: University of Detroit and Mercy College of Detroit. The two consolidated in 1990. Detroit Mercy offers more than 100 undergraduate, graduate, professional degrees, and programs through seven schools/colleges, including nationally ranked engineering, business management, health and psychology programs, an AACSB-accredited business college, an NAAB-accredited architecture school and STEM and liberal arts programs. The University is well known for its academic excellence and ability to positively impact Detroit and SE Michigan communities through service opportunities.Each year, 1,500 Detroit Mercy students provide more than 12,000 hours of volunteer service with 100 community service agencies. Community service extends to opportunities beyond Michigan and the U.S. University Ministry offers trips based on social justice themes during all university breaks. Trips provide students with opportunities to work for the common good and reflect on their experiences in the context of a diverse community. Immersions are key experiences of a trans-formative Jesuit and Mercy education rooted in social justice. Over the years, students and employees have worked on the Encuentro Project, an immigration/border trip in El Paso, Texas; and immigration/martyrs/human rights trip in San Salvador, El Salvador. During COVID-19, students virtually tutored local grade school and high school students through Ministry's Service in the City program.The University offers professional practice and community outreach services. The School of Law provides 30,000 hours of legal assistance to residents of Detroit and surrounding communities through 11 clinics. Through a mobile dental clinic and school-based dental sealant program, the School of Dentistry offers dental health services and education throughout Michigan. Last year, Dentistry completed 59,730 patient visits totaling $732,303 in uncompensated care. Despite COVID-19, the McAuley Health Center provided health services to underserved individuals of all ages, resulting in more than 2,000 patient visits last fiscal year. Our Counseling Clinic serves 250 individuals each year, providing no-cost counseling to residents who would not have access to mental health care. The Psychology Clinic offers assessment, testing and psychotherapy for those of all ages including students each year. The Detroit Collaborative Design Center provides design services to non-profit community and civic organizations citywide, working on more than 22 pro-jects in 2020. Approximately 20 Fortune 500 companies and nationally recognized healthcare facilities partner with our co-ops and internships that prepare students with real-world experience and provide career opportunities.", "totalUndergrads": 2633, "totalGradsAndPros": 2354, "pctPell": 33, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 36, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 64}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 0.9, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 15, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 85}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", "100%"]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 1, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 99}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 2, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 98}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Not offered", "vRotcOffArmy": "Not offered", "vRotcOffNavy": "Not offered", "csAvgCost": 18356, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 13879, "nptMed1": 15023, "nptMed2": 17242, "nptHi1": 20735, "nptHi2": 23366}, "netPriceCalculator": "https://www.udmercy.edu/admission/financial-aid/cost/netprice-calc.php", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 24250, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 9500, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 21009, "mdIncDebtMdn": 19798, "hiIncDebtMdn": 19500}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 231, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 31847, "pctIncuredDebt": 66, "vGiBill": 1, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 49, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 75, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["co-op education", "on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "placement service", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "3D Printers, Advanced Engineering Lab, Architecture Model Photo Studio, Archive Research Center, Assistive Technology Lab, AV Recording Studios, Center for Automotive Systems Engineering, Center for Cyber Security & Intelligence Analysis, Counseling Clinic, Dental Clinics, Detroit Collaborative Design Center, Digital Media Studio, Electron Spin Resonance & X-ray Fluorescence Spectrometry, Financial Markets Lab, Gardela Honors House, Ion Chromatography, PRIME Center Studio, Radio Station, Segway", "vProServAva": ["remedial math", "remedial English", "diagnostic testing service", "note-taking services", "oral tests", "learning center", "readers", "extended time for tests", "tutors", "early syllabus", "priority registration", "priority seating", "substitution of courses", "typist/scribe", "exams on tape or computer", "other testing accommodations", "waiver of math degree requirement"], "vGuiSpePgm": ["note-taking services", "tutors", "reader services", "interpreters for hearing-impaired", "talking books"], "guidnceCmpsAcsblty": "Mostly"}, {"primaryKey": "1999", "xwalkId": "157289", "urlName": "university-of-louisville", "displayName": "University of Louisville", "shortName": "University of Louisville", "city": "Louisville", "state": "KY", "zip": "40292", "website": "http://www.louisville.edu", "streetAddress1": "2301 S.

UofL serves as an engine that powers Metro Louisville and the commonwealth. Our more than 22,000 students, 7,000 faculty and staff, and 140,000 alumni create and apply knowledge that improves lives. UofL is a top producer of Fulbright awards, with more than 130 UofL students and alumni earning this international studies award since 2003. This total is greater than all of Kentucky's other public universities combined and is on par with several Ivy League universities. UofL offers more than 200 degree programs in 12 schools and colleges. The city also serves as a classroom for UofL students, who benefit from internships and partnerships with Fortune 500 companies such as Kindred Healthcare, Ford, Humana, Yum! Brands and others, as well as Metropolitan College, a unique work-study program with UPS. The latest addition to UofL's urban oasis is the Belknap Academic Building, which houses four stories of modern instructional space and a student success center. Ekstrom Library added the Teaching Innovation Learning Lab, where instructors experiment with new technology and equipment to enhance learning opportunities for students. Other noteworthy facilities include one of the nation's top 10 academic clean rooms, where work in bioengineering, nanotechnology and other high-demand fields takes place. Apartment-style housing and an expanded Student Activities Center provide first-class places to live and play on campus. UofL is a leader in research with faculty who conducted the world's first successful implantation of an artificial heart and the nation's first successful hand transplant. Our faculty lead the world's first FDA-approved clinical trial using adult cardiac stem cells to treat heart disease and pioneered the use of locomotor training to help paralyzed patients walk again. Innovation runs rampant across UofL, and corporate partners are joining in to help bridge the tech gap. UofL partnered with Microsoft to explore the future of artificial intelligence and provide digital literacy training and is working with IBM to establish a program to provide curriculum and educational tools concentrated on eight fast-growing technology areas. UofL is a hub for advanced manufacturing. Through partnerships with industry leaders such as General Electric, faculty and students are able to interact with makers from around the world, whether they are present physically or connected virtually. UofL recently expanded its healthcare enterprise by acquiring several Louisville-area health assets including UofL Health - Jewish Hospital, UofL Health - Frazier Rehab Institute, three additional regional hospitals, four regional medical centers and numerous physician groups. The expanded UofL Health enterprise ensures a continuation of high-quality medical care to patients throughout our community and beyond. UofL stands out for its efforts to serve the needs of its community. One of only 69 universities in the United States to achieve Carnegie Foundation Research 1 and Community Engaged University status, UofL is ranked among the nation's best universities for African American and LGBTQ+ students. UofL's Signature Partnership, a project to improve social, cultural, educational, health care and economic development services in a historically underserved area of Louisville, is considered a national model for community engagement. UofL remains committed to ensuring a nurturing and challenging intellectual climate that demonstrates a genuine understanding of how diversity enriches a vibrant metropolitan research university.

One of 17 institutions in the world-class University of North Carolina System, UNCW is continuously recognized for its superb faculty and staff, scholarly excellence and affordability. The university's efforts to advance research and scholarly activities earned it the elevated designation of \"Doctoral Universities: High Research Activity\" institution by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education in 2018. UNCW ranked 95th on the U.S. News list of 2021 Top 100 Public National Universities. Nearly 18,000 students were enrolled in fall 2020, a record for UNCW. The university boasts an all-time high number of enrolled Honors and military-affiliated students and a 6-year graduation rate of 74%. The graduate student population continues to grow at double-digit rates, a sign of high demand for the university's quality programs. UNCW offers a full range of baccalaureate- and graduate-level programs; doctoral degrees in educational leadership, marine biology, nursing practice and psychology; and many distance learning options, including clinical research, an accelerated RN-to-BSN program and an Executive MBA. The fields of education, nursing and public health continue to rely on the skills of UNCW graduates, fueling the economic engine of southeastern North Carolina. The Master of Healthcare Administration and Master of Arts in Integrated Marketing Communication programs graduated their first cohorts in the spring of 2021. UNCW has thrived despite the challenges of the global COVID-19 pandemic. As its enrollment numbers and program offerings expand, so does its physical campus. UNCW paid homage to its founding as a school for World War II veterans with the opening of Veterans Hall. The 145,000-square-foot facility houses the College of Health and Human Services and faculty and staff from the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Office of Military Affairs. Dobo Hall, a 110,000-square-foot science building that sustained extensive damage during 2018's Hurricane Florence, has been fully renovated. Fall 2021 will welcome four new residence halls fully opened, a new film studies building, a new dining facility and construction underway on a coastal engineering building. As an R2 institution, UNCW recognizes that strategic support of scholarship, innovation and research is fundamental to the institutional DNA, as emphasized in its Strategic Plan. Renowned for its excellence in coastal and marine science, UNCW has also accomplished much in research and innovation activities related to psychology, artificial intelligence and international trade and exchange. Five faculty members were recently inducted into the James F. Merritt Million Dollar Club, an honor for those who have secured $1 million or more in external research funding. In July 2020, UNCW launched the Chancellor's Renewal and Change Accountability Committee to work alongside the university's administration to develop strategies and propose solutions to address issues of diversity, equity and inclusion. UNCW is recognized nationally as a military-friendly university and works closely with Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps Air Station New River to offer quality programs designed for military personnel, veterans and their families. To date, UNCW has raised more than $86 million as part of a multi-year fundraising campaign to support students, faculty, programs and facilities. Every gift, no matter its size or the area it supports, counts toward the campaign's goal while helping drive progress in health care; education; sustainability and diversity, equity and inclusion.",

Recognized by the Carnegie Foundation as an R1-Very High Research Activity doctoral university, MSU is confronting global challenges head-on. Through leadership in domestic and international research consortiums, MSU is spearheading advancements in unmanned aerial systems, enhancing aquaculture to eradicate global hunger and developing improved curricula and training for the next generation of scientists and engineers. MSU researchers are building crime-fighting robots, advancing off-road self-driving technology, and strengthening the blue economy via research on seafood safety and new product innovation. They're also helping restore life-sustaining marshlands along the Gulf Coast, partnering with NASA on future space exploration and pioneering antidotes to defeat harmful nerve agents and save lives. Additionally, MSU houses one of the world's fastest academic supercomputer systems, providing a powerful engine that accelerates research efforts. By launching an online archive of approximately five decades of agricultural seed technology research, MSU is ushering in a new era of open data and information sharing that will play an important role in improved global health, safety and food security. In fact, the National Science Foundation ranks MSU in the nation's top 5% for agriculture and natural resources - a position it has held for over two decades. In the realm of health care and medicine, MSU researchers are studying machine-learning techniques to predict heart disease and using virtual reality to improve communication skills in children with autism. Playing an essential role in all of Mississippi's 82 counties, MSU's Extension Service offers education-based programs to improve health care in rural, medically underserved communities. Innovation also is a hallmark of MSU's College of Veterinary Medicine, where students are excelling in rescue and rehabilitation of vulnerable marine animals along Mississippi's Gulf Coast and pioneering life-saving breakthroughs in the diagnosis and treatment of pet diseases such as cancer and epilepsy. MSU is also helping establish the next generation of business leaders and CEOs. At MSU's Center for Entrepreneurship & Outreach, the university fosters innovation and entrepreneurship by helping students plan, launch and grow successful companies. While the future is our focus, MSU values the knowledge that can be gained from studying the past. As home of the Ulysses S. Grant Presidential Library and Frank and Virginia Williams Collection of Lincolniana, MSU is one of the nation's foremost repositories for Civil War research and one of just six universities in the U.S. to house a presidential library. At Mississippi State, we're moving to make life better than it was when we arrived - a commitment that rings true for today and for years to come.", "totalUndergrads": 18803, "totalGradsAndPros": 4183, "pctPell": 32, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 50, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 50}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 4.4, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 26, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 74}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", "65%"], ["women's dorms", "8%"], ["men's dorms", "3%"], ["sorority housing", "7%"], ["fraternity housing", "6%"], ["apartment for single students", "11%"], ["theme housing", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 15, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 85}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 18, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 82}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Not offered", "csAvgCost": 16173, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 13986, "nptMed1": 13799, "nptMed2": 18007, "nptHi1": 19558, "nptHi2": 19741}, "netPriceCalculator": "http://www.sfa.msstate.edu", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 22865, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 8400, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 15000, "mdIncDebtMdn": 15000, "hiIncDebtMdn": 15000}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 218, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 25339, "pctIncuredDebt": 56, "vGiBill": 3, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 46, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 4200, "regAlcPermYesno": "No", "vGuiServAva": ["co-op education", "on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "placement service", "day care", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Student patrols", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Cully Cobb Museum of Archaeology- Antiques & primitive tools; Department of Art Gallery; Dunn Seller Museum -

Nationally known for producing talented graduates in the health and medical sciences, including nursing, occupational therapy, physical therapy, medical imaging, and speech-language pathology, Misericordia students also find quality academic programs in business and the humanities including the new collaborative, interdisciplinary Environmental Studies major. In total, MU offers a combined 38 degree programs at the undergraduate, graduate, and doctorate levels. Misericordia also offers over 40 clubs, service organizations, and special interest organizations as well as 25 NCAA Division III sports for men and women, as well as Esports, a coed varsity activity.  According to national surveys, Misericordia students rate the quality of interactions with faculty, staff, and students higher than students at comparable colleges and universities. By the time they are seniors, Misericordia students say they are academically challenged and engage in reflective and integrated learning at a rate higher than other comparable schools.  Students at MU report they acquire work-related skills more often than students at similar universities do. This is important because these work-related skills, combined with Misericordia's liberal arts based curriculum, form an attractive combination for prospective employers. To support career preparation among students, Misericordia's Guaranteed Career Placement Program offers a pledge of a paid internship for those students who successfully complete the program but do not obtain a job in their field or a slot in graduate school within six months of graduation. Recent economic research indicates that MU alumni earn higher mid-career salaries than might be expected which shows the \"value-added\" elements of the Misericordia education in the workplace. In the tradition of its founders, the Religious Sisters of Mercy, Misericordia believes that serving others builds better leaders and leads to successful careers and rewarding lives. The University offers special service learning opportunities in our local community as well as around the country and internationally.  At Misericordia, students can expect a compelling experience and an education interwoven with the values that originally guided the Sisters of Mercy to establish the college almost a century ago.  These values are represented within our charisms - Mercy, Service, Justice, and Hospitality. The University's research focus stresses teaching and learning. Undergraduate research programs in several disciplines including the health sciences, humanities, biology, and chemistry are popular. Students have opportunities for hands-on experience in a collaborative learning environment where faculty are personally engaged in students' education. Noted for its beautiful 127-acre suburban campus and expanding lower campus, the University boasts a first-rate library, on-campus athletics complex, a modern dining hall, and food court hosting a Chick-Fil-A Express and The Chopping Block, new and renovated residence halls, an artificial surface soccer and lacrosse field, and a newly constructed $45 million science center equipped with the latest, most advanced technology.

of tomorrow.With a student population of nearly 29,000, East Carolina is a large university that is committed to giving every student an education fit for the 21st century, as well as the challenges and opportunities they need to become the leaders in their fields. The sizable student body benefits from small classrooms that, at every level, are led by experienced faculty members.Students take advantage of the Global Classroom, which connects students with their peers around their globe.

The School of Dental Medicine trains students in community service-learning centers, where they continue to learn as they help patients who lack regular access to dental care.ECU's impact extends beyond its research capabilities. More than 187 health and human service agencies benefit each year from nearly 10,000 students giving hundreds of thousands of volunteer hours. Their acts of generosity have included organizing after-school recreation events, writing grants for local non-profit organizations, and collecting thousands of pounds of clothing, food, and other items for Give & Go. The university has also made large strides in helping the members of the US Armed Forces. Dr. Carmen Russoniello has helped soldiers recover from post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury through the use of gaming technology and biofeedback techniques. ECU has distributed free football tickets to the men and women of the military. For several years East Carolina has been named as one of Military Times' \"Best for Vets Colleges\", and was also named a \"Military Friendly School\" for embracing service members, veterans and their families.Students also develop the qualities necessary to make them tomorrows leaders. The ECU Leadership Challenge instills leadership values in students through challenging activities and dialogue. Sponsored series bring in leading figures in multiple subjects each year to share their experiences and wisdom. East Carolina's Army ROTC has competed in the elite Sandhurst competition at West Point, demonstrating their commitment to excellence.The university also improves the quality of life in North Carolina, both economically and culturally. It generates nearly $3 billion annually for the state economy.  The Division of Research, Economic Development and Engagement creates partnerships between ECU and the region to promote entrepreneurship and create jobs. East Carolina's cultural impact is seen through its art exhibits and more than 150 musical performances each year. \tEast Carolina University continues to do today what it began more than 100 years ago: train every student to not only participate in the world but to also shape it.", "totalUndergrads": 23056, "totalGradsAndPros": 5742, "pctPell": 34, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 43, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 57}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 2.4, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": null, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": null}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", ""], ["women's dorms", ""], ["sorority housing", ""], ["fraternity housing", ""], ["special housing for disabled students", ""], ["theme housing", ""], ["wellness housing", ""], ["other housing options", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 0, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 0}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 0, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 0}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Not offered", "csAvgCost": 15844, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 11026, "nptMed1": 12195, "nptMed2": 15784, "nptHi1": 19933, "nptHi2": 21104}, "netPriceCalculator": "go.ecu.edu/calculator", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 24409, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 8750, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 18750, "mdIncDebtMdn": 18500, "hiIncDebtMdn": 17161}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 233, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 29184, "pctIncuredDebt": 67, "vGiBill": 7, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 53, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 1600, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["co-op education", "on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "women's center", "placement service", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Student patrols", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Museums/Buildings: Wellington B.

The Pleasantville Campus in Westchester County, only an hour by train from New York City, offers students the traditional suburban collegiate setting with state-of-the-art renovations on a 200-acre bucolic campus and 14 NCAA Division II teams. The White Plains Campus, home to the Elisabeth Haub School of Law, is situated in the heart of White Plains' buzzing suburban sprawl.

Through its growth and dedication, Texas Tech has developed into a premier institution of higher education that is sought after by students around the world.Texas Tech University in Lubbock has the distinction of being the largest comprehensive higher education institution in the western two-thirds of the state of Texas. It is the major institution of higher education in a region larger than 46 of the nation's 50 states.Founded as Texas Technological College, in 1923, the school opened two years later with six buildings and 910 students, with the first graduate-level instruction beginning in 1927. The college served as a training ground for U.S. Army pilots during World War II and, in the post-war years, saw its enrollment soar. The School of Law welcomed its first class in 1967. The School of Medicine was created in May 1969, just a few months before the college formally became Texas Tech University on Sept. 1. By the mid-1970s, Texas Tech had six colleges - Agricultural Sciences, Arts & Sciences, Business Administration, Education, Engineering and Home Economics - in addition to the Graduate School and the School of Law. The School of Medicine, School of Pharmacy and School of Nursing became their own separate institution on June 6, 1979, when the Texas Legislature officially designated the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center.Today, Texas Tech University is one of five component institutions of the Texas Tech University System, which was formed in 1996. Texas Tech now has 10 colleges, the Graduate School, the School of Law, the School of Veterinary Medicine in Amarillo, eight regional sites throughout the state of Texas and an entire division dedicated to online students. The institution extended its international footprint with the opening of TTU Costa Rica in August 2018.For more than a decade, Texas Tech has achieved record enrollment figures each fall, including 40,322 students in 2020, showing that the university continues to be a desired location for those who want to continue their education. In addition to overall enrollment, Texas Tech also consistently sets new marks for graduate student enrollment, four- and six-year graduation rates and first-year retention rates, key measures that indicate the quality of education students receive. In 2019, Texas Tech achieved full status as a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI), boasting an undergraduate Hispanic student population of more than 29%.In terms of research, Texas Tech has made tremendous strides in establishing the university as a top research institution, achieving record total research expenditures. In 2012, the university was the first of eight emerging research universities in Texas to achieve the benchmarks for designation as a National Research University.Texas Tech was one of the original 76 colleges and universities that received the Elective Community Engagement Classification from the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching in 2006, the year Carnegie launched the designation, which is based on a university's community engagement as shown through an aligned mission, culture, leadership, resources and practices.

Headquartered in New York City, TCUS originated with the opening of Touro College in New York in 1971. Touro was founded primarily to enrich the Jewish heritage and to serve the larger American and global community. Today approximately 19 ,200 students are enrolled at its schools and divisions, which include 30 campuses and locations in New York, California, Nevada, Illinois, Berlin, Jerusalem and Moscow.  In New York Touro provides diverse, innovative and engaging courses in a range of fields - from medicine, dentistry and pharmacy to law, business, education, social work and allied health - all reflecting a commitment to values and respect for applied knowledge and discovery. Students from diverse backgrounds and cultures experience an atmosphere of warmth, close faculty-student relationships, and student camaraderie. Individual attention nurtures and promotes student success. In New York, Touro has three medical schools (New York Medical College [NYMC] and Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine in Harlem and Middletown); a school of pharmacy; a new school of dentistry, and a school of health sciences that - when combined with schools of medicine, pharmacy and health sciences in Nevada and California - make TCUS one of the largest health care educators in the U.S. Other strong graduate and professional programs flourish in New York at the Jacob D. Fuchsberg Law Center and at graduate schools of social work, business, technology, education and Jewish studies. Students benefit from affiliations between Touro's undergraduate and graduate and professional schools; from many inter-professional education opportunities; and from engagement in scientific and social science research with peers and faculty. For instance, an Academic and Jewish Studies Honors Program allows exceptional students to cultivate their intellectual gifts through advanced analytical research in a chosen discipline, as well as in Talmud study and the liberal arts and sciences. A Medical Honors Pathway established with NYMC affords students from three of Touro's Lander undergraduate colleges (Lander College of Arts & Sciences in Brooklyn; Lander College for Women - The Anna Ruth and Mark Hasten School in Manhattan; and Lander College for Men in Queens) opportunities to continue studies at NYMC after undergraduate work. Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine in Harlem and Middletown; Touro College of Pharmacy in Harlem; and the School of Health Sciences offer an Integrated Honors Track for aspiring osteopathic physicians, pharmacists, physician assistants and physical therapists. Touro College of Pharmacy has agreements with the City University of New York's Hunter College, Lehman College and Medgar Evers College; Ramapo College in New Jersey; and Touro's New York School of Career and Applied Studies to provide undergraduates a fast-track to a Doctor of Pharmacy degree. Touro's small classes help students succeed, as research has shown that meaningful interaction with faculty can positively influence performance. Students are also supported with tutoring, career guidance, internship placements and flexible scheduling to accommodate work schedules. Touro is proud of its diversity and ability to educate students from all backgrounds including those who are underserved, as well as the economic return provided students and families. Touro's student-centered, supportive environment adds up to high graduation rates and alumni earnings, and empowers students and prepares them for the future. Notable alumni include U.S. Representative Kathleen Rice, NYC Criminal Court Judge Rachel Freier, Senior Advisor to the Director of the National Security Agency Anne Neuberger, NYS Senator Kenneth LaValle and former NYC Councilman David Greenfield, currently CEO of Met Council.", "totalUndergrads": 5520, "totalGradsAndPros": 6179, "pctPell": 45, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist":

Through the Center for Undergraduate Research, students collaborate with UMaine's world-class scientists and scholars in the Maine Business School and our colleges: Engineering; Liberal Arts and Sciences; Natural Sciences, Forestry, and Agriculture; Education and Human Development; and Honors. Students are engaged in hands-on learning, including helping wildlife experts tag black bear cubs, traversing Antarctic ice sheets, using zebrafish to conduct medical research, studying on Bloomberg Terminals in our Capital Markets Training Laboratory, working with marine species at our Darling Marine Center, participating in Congressional and state legislative internships, exhibiting in juried art shows, and honing pre-teaching skills in a state-of-the-art virtual classroom with avatar simulation. UMaine's outdoor adventure center, Maine Bound, provides students with 15 miles of trails just off campus and guide-led trips statewide for hiking, rock climbing, kayaking, snowshoeing and more. With Acadia National Park, Sugarloaf Mountain and Mount Katahdin nearby, the possibilities of adventure are endless.", "totalUndergrads": 9465, "totalGradsAndPros": 2276, "pctPell": 31, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 54, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 46}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 4.5, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 29, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 71}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", ""], ["sorority housing", ""], ["fraternity housing", ""], ["apartments for married students", ""], ["special housing for disabled students", ""], ["special housing for international students", ""], ["theme housing", ""], ["wellness housing", ""], ["other housing options", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 0, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 0}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 0, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 0}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Not offered", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Offered on campus", "csAvgCost": 17558, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 13989, "nptMed1": 14458, "nptMed2": 17218, "nptHi1": 20312, "nptHi2": 20987}, "netPriceCalculator": "http://umaine.edu/netpricecalculator/", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 25500, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 9250, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 18510, "mdIncDebtMdn": 18357, "hiIncDebtMdn": 15750}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 243, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 35036, "pctIncuredDebt": 72, "vGiBill": 5, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 57, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 660, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["co-op education", "on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "women's center", "placement service", "day care", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Student patrols", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Planetarium and observatory;

The state's land-grant university, NMSU is a reflection of the Southwest vibrant mix of ethnic and cultural communities and, indeed, of the future demographic of the United States. A personalized small-college setting combined with the resources of a large research university allows NMSU to offer curricula designed to encourage self-discovery, student learning and success. Data show that these degree programs, guided by NMSU's top-rated and award-winning faculty, help all scholars, no matter their educational background, reach their full potential by the time they graduate. Also key to undergraduate and graduate success at NMSU is the extent to which students can participate in research and community service programs.  The university's Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) outreach programs are working with area public schools to build the number of students from underrepresented groups who pursue careers in these fields. NMSU is home to the first-of-its-kind HSI STEM Resource Hub network in the country to share best practices among the 450 Hispanic-serving institutions to build capacity for STEM education.  The university's wide-ranging research investigations touch many areas of human endeavor, with programs focused on water and energy resources, food safety, environmental issues, homeland security, and border health issues. For example, NMSU students and faculty are exploring alternative energy sources, including hydrogen fuel cells, solar energy, Smart Grid technology and wind power. Environmental challenges are the focus of WERC: A Consortium for Environmental Education and Technology Development. Innovative research is focused on providing clean water to the nations communities through desalination, brackish water utilization and contaminant removal techniques to ensure safe water supplies. Research on desert ecology is conducted at the university's Chihuahuan Desert Rangeland Research Center, and NMSU administers the NSF-funded Jornada Basin Long-Term Ecological Research Project. NMSU's Jornada Experimental Range is also home to one of 10 regional \"Climate Hubs\" in the U.S. designated to address increasing risks such as fires, invasive pests, devastating floods and crippling droughts on a regional basis. NMSU's Arrowhead Center is an innovation hub for the state, a portal to link researchers and entrepreneurs with ideas for how to solve market problems and take advantage of market opportunities that will keep New Mexico on the leading edge of discovery and sustainable economic growth.  At the forefront of space exploration efforts for many years, NMSU's aerospace and astronomy research programs deepen our knowledge of space. NMSU operates Apache Point Observatory, home of the Astrophysical Research Consortium's 3.5-meter telescope and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey telescope and runs the Solar Observatory at Sunspot, NM. NMSU's Physical Science Lab (PSL) partners with corporations and government agencies to offer students opportunities to participate in sponsored projects in a supportive, mentored environment. In keeping with the land-grant mission, NMSU provides extension and outreach programs that benefit communities locally, statewide and globally. For instance, university extension programs help small farmers increase crop yields and utilize limited water supplies, while also providing innovative and accessible educational resources for small businesses. NMSU's museum conservation program is one of only three in the country. NMSU also is home to the world's only Chile Pepper Institute, a research-based, international nonprofit organization devoted to education, research and archiving information related to capsicum. In all its facets, NMSU shines as a place where students have a multitude of possibilities for learning -- truly a place transforming lives through disc", "totalUndergrads": 11575,

Benedictine college best known for health care education with a liberal arts foundation. St. Scholastica has proven its leadership during its 106-year history. St. Scholastica's nursing program is one of the largest and most respected in Minnesota. In the mid-1930s, the College began the nation's first program in medical records. Today the field is called Health Informatics and Information Management, and the College is still a national leader at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. St. Scholastica's new Health Science Center features state-of-the-art classrooms and laboratories for a new Physician Assistant program that started in fall 2017, as well as expanded Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy departments. The facility also is home to the maurices Community Clinic, an interdisciplinary academic program that integrates classroom teaching and experiential teaching. This offers students supervised \"hands-on\" experience working with adults and children who are underinsured or uninsured. St. Scholastica's mission is to provide intellectual and moral preparation for responsible living and meaningful work. The College is guided by Catholic Benedictine values of respect, hospitality, community, stewardship, and the love of learning. Beginning early in the 20th century, the Benedictine Sisters advanced gender equity by providing educational opportunities to young women well before women had the right to vote. Through higher education, the Benedictines strove to provide quality healthcare and meet the workforce needs of immigrant populations. They also excelled in supporting first-generation college students who might otherwise not have had access to a higher education. This approach continues today through the College's commitment to inclusive excellence, which builds and nurtures a learning and working community in which all members - especially those who feel marginalized by the larger society - are welcome, valued and supported for who they are. The College also serves as a regional center for culture, leading public interfaith discussions of ethics and peace and justice issues in the tradition of its Catholic Benedictine intellectual heritage. Service to the community and region is an integral part of the St. Scholastica experience. U.S. News & World Report consistently ranks The College of St. Scholastica among the best colleges and universities in the Upper Midwest for academic excellence. St. Scholastica is ranked first among 31 colleges in Minnesota for its overall economic mobility index, which measures the likelihood that a student who graduates moves up by at least two income categories, on a scale of five, from where she or he started. Not only is the College the top school in Minnesota - it is in the top five percent nationwide on this upward economic mobility measure. The College is nationally known for being supportive of military veterans, as cited by U.S. News & World Report. Money Magazine included St. Scholastica on its 2017-18 Best Colleges list, ranking the College at no. 119 out of 711 based on quality of education, affordability, and outcomes. Forbes magazine named St. Scholastica to its Top Colleges list, based on outcomes metrics including student satisfaction, post-graduate success, and academic success. Along with providing a foundation for responsible living, St. Scholastica also offers real-world impact for its graduates. Ninety-seven percent of undergraduate students are employed or enrolled in a graduate program within six months of graduation. St. Scholastica offers a distinctive four-year pledge: that new students who enter as first-year undergraduate students and follow simple guidelines will graduate in four years, or subsequent tuition is free. The Duluth campus is on a forested ridge overlooking Lake Superior, a tranquil setting for scholarship that many people think is the most beautiful campus in Minnesota.", "totalUndergrads": 2244, "totalGradsAndPros": 1468, "pctPell": 27, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 29, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 71}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 3.9, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 39, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 61}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", ""], ["apartment for single students", ""], ["special housing for disabled students", ""], ["special housing for international students", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 0, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 0}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 0, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 0}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered at cooperating institution", "vRotcOffArmy": "Not offered", "vRotcOffNavy": "Not offered", "csAvgCost": 24066, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 18502, "nptMed1": 22004, "nptMed2": 22813, "nptHi1": 24383, "nptHi2": 29468}, "netPriceCalculator": "http://www.css.edu/Undergraduate/Paying-For-College/Net-Price-Calculator--Freshmen.html", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 20500, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 9094, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 16573, "mdIncDebtMdn": 16687, "hiIncDebtMdn": 18154}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 196, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 41539, "pctIncuredDebt": 73, "vGiBill": 0, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 64, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 186, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "placement service", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "The Little Theatre, Cadaver Lab", "vProServAva": ["reading machines", "note-taking services", "oral tests", "learning center", "readers", "extended time for tests", "tutors", "priority registration", "priority seating", "substitution of courses", "typist/scribe", "exams on tape or computer", "other testing accommodations", "waiver of foreign language degree requirement", "waiver of math degree requirement"], "vGuiSpePgm": ["note-taking services", "special transportation", "tape recorders", "special housing", "tutors", "adaptive equipment", "reader services", "interpreters for hearing-impaired", "talking books"], "guidnceCmpsAcsblty": "Mostly"}, {"primaryKey": "3848", "xwalkId": "238661", "urlName": "edgewood-college", "displayName": "Edgewood College", "shortName": "Edgewood College", "city": "Madison", "state": "WI", "zip": "53711", "website": "http://www.edgewood.edu", "streetAddress1": "1000 Edgewood College Drive", "streetAddress2": null, "phone": "(608) 663-4861", "institutionalControl": "private", "privateTuition": ["$31,700", "(2020-21)"], "inStateTuition": "N/A", "outStateTuition": "N/A", "roomAndBoard": ["$11,700", "(2020-21)"], "enrollment": ["1,407", "(fall 2019)"], "latitude": 43.0336, "longitude": -89.4513, "applicationDeadline": "August 1", "usnews_category": "2", "ranks": {"national-universities_overall": "#239", "national-universities_social-mobility": "#95", "nursing_overall": "#432"}, "topMajors": [], "cSelectClass": "Selective", "rCAcceptRate": 72, "actSatiLatestDate": "August 1", "gClassSizes": {"vClasses1": null, "vClasses2": null, "vClasses3": null}, "gStudentGenderDistribution": {"vPctUnderMen": null, "vPctUnderWomen": null}, "totalAllStudents": 2038, "association": "NCAA III", "g_financial_aid_statistics": {"pctApplyFinAid": null, "pctNeedFullyMet": null, "pctRecvAidFt": null, "pctSelfHelpFt": null, "avgPctNeedMetFt": null}, "vPrivateTuition": 31700, "wRoomBoard": 11700, "guiAddServIns": "Yes", "schoolStatementText": "Edgewood College is completing the Spring 2020 semester fully-online, using robust tools available to each and every student.

Its six campuses in downtown and metro Atlanta provide its more than 54,000 students with unsurpassed connections to the city's business, government, nonprofit and cultural communities as well as opportunities in an environment of varied ideas, cultures, ages, lifestyles and experiences. Atlanta, home to more than a dozen headquarters of Fortune 500 companies, provides Georgia State's faculty and students with an urban laboratory, enabling them to draw creative inspiration and address critical societal issues locally and in cities around the world. Georgia State is recognized as the national leader in creating innovative approaches that foster the success of students from all academic, socio-economic, racial and ethnic backgrounds. It has a university-wide commitment to student advising and attention to student progress to graduation. Georgia State is one of a handful of large institutions nationwide using new technology to track students from the moment they arrive on campus to ensure their progress to graduation. With the university's early-warning tracking system, struggling students get the intervention they need to get back on track, improve or change their academic path. Georgia State is among the most diverse universities in the nation. Georgia State has been recognized by U.S. News & World Report as the No. 3 most innovative university in the nation and the No.1 public university for its commitment to undergraduate teaching. It is among the country's fastest growing research institutions. The university's 10-year strategic plan, introduced in 2011, aims to enhance research and discovery, in part by implementing a hiring initiative to build scholarly strength around interdisciplinary research themes. It also focuses on efforts to make the university a leader in undergraduate student success and puts renewed emphasis on improving graduate education. The plan emphasizes the university's commitment to addressing issues and problems confronting cities around the globe, and establishes as a priority the institution's initiatives to extend its global involvement and influence. Georgia State, founded in 1913, is central to the revitalization of downtown Atlanta, expanding its downtown campus and building a more robust student residential community. More than 5,000 students now live in residence halls on a campus that once served commuting students exclusively. Georgia State's consolidation in 2016 with Georgia Perimeter College, a two-year institution, made it the largest university in Georgia and one of the largest in the nation. Its efforts to enhance student life and campus involvement included the introduction of a Division 1 football program in 2010 and membership in the Sun Belt athletic conference of the NCAA's Football Bowl Subdivision in 2013. The university offers 55 undergraduate and graduate degree programs in more than 250 fields of study in its academic colleges, schools and units, the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, the Byrdine F. Lewis College of Nursing and Health Professions, the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of the Arts, the College of Education, the College of Law, the Honors College, the Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Perimeter College, the J.

Military Times has named UMSL to its \"Best for Vets\" list for six consecutive years.

Founded in 1867 as one of the original public land-grant universities, we've always put the needs of our state and students first. Today, the WVU System is statewide. From our flagship campus in Morgantown, just 75 miles south of Pittsburgh, to the technology-intensive programs at WVU Tech in Beckley to the career-focused majors at WVU Potomac State College in Keyser, we have a home for everyone. WVU is one of only 130 institutions to receive the highest research designation, R1. Our students are claiming their place in history, with 59 Fulbright, 45 Goldwater, 23 Truman, 49 Gilman, 25 Boren and 25 Rhodes scholars. And WVU is ranked in the top 3% of the universities by the Center for World University Rankings, the largest academic ranking of its kind. WVU is one of only about a dozen land-grant, doctoral research universities in the country with a comprehensive medical school. We are also a space-grant university, part of a network formed for outer space-related research. WVU offers over 380 majors at the bachelor's, master's and doctoral levels in 14 academic schools and colleges, including dentistry, law, medicine, nursing, pharmacy and public health. Top areas of research range from STEM education to rural healthcare, natural resources utilization to radio astronomy. WVU partnered with the FBI to found one of the first accredited forensic science programs in the nation and has the largest crime scene training complex in the world, with four crime scene houses, a forensic garage, an 18,000-square-foot lab and the country's first graduate law degree program in forensic justice. The FBI has also named us its national leader for biometrics research. The WVU Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute is the only research center in the world dedicated to studying human memory. WVU established one of the first personalized STEM tutoring programs for student-veterans, hosts one of only three puppetry degree programs in the country and is one of only three institutions with a joint petroleum and natural gas engineering ABET-accredited major. In Morgantown, ranked the #1 \"Fastest Growing City in the State\" by MSN Money, students participate in over 400 student organizations and give more than 150,000 annual hours of service, helping us earn the Carnegie Foundation's Community Engagement Classification -- joining only 6% of all universities. At the Student Recreation Center, students can swim, do yoga and scale a 50-foot climbing wall. Nearby, whitewater, mountain climbing, skiing and hiking abound. A member of the Big 12, WVU has 18 intercollegiate sports with access to the best facilities, like the new, $21 million Monongalia County Ballpark. Students make friends and challenge themselves in Adventure WV, an orientation program available for only $95 (free to Pell-Grant eligible students). But WVU is more than just a place -- or a set of stats. It's a spirit. A promise. A mission.

student engagement in ways that educate the whole person and inspire student success and fulfillment.  Liberal arts education provides the foundation of the College educational experience for all academic programs, including those leading to a professional degree.  The curriculum is infused with exposure to ethical considerations, experiential learning opportunities, and thoughtful reflection that, together, help students translate theory and research into practical tools for principled decision making and creative problem solving at work, at home, and in the global community. This intentional combination of liberal arts, professional programs, and experiential learning is designed to produce open-minded critical thinkers who understand diverse people and perspectives and are prepared to lead in their chosen profession.  By encouraging faith and values exploration and deliberately surrounding the students with meaningful opportunities for student development and engagement in learning communities outside the classroom and beyond campus borders, we encourage each student to embrace our core values of community, character, and responsible citizenship.

The University's success can be explained by its bachelor's, master's and doctoral degree programs that connect with high-demand career fields and prepare students for the global marketplace, an ever-expanding research portfolio and a growing international presence. DSU's academic character has a heavy emphasis in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) area. Several major research centers are based on campus, including the Delaware Institute for Science and Technology's Optical Science Center for Applied Research (OSCAR), with its state-of-the-art facility completed in 2015, as well as the Delaware Center for Neuroscience Research. The University's Claude E. Phillips Herbarium, a botanical resource center, is the largest among HBCUs. In the College of Business, students gain knowledge of the latest SAP technologies and critical digital enterprise skills through a partnership with SAP, the market leader in enterprise application software, and the Americas' SAP Users' Group (ASUG). Students in DSU's Aviation Program attain valuable flight experience in the University's own fleet of airplanes, the only one among HBCUs, and 100 percent of our professional pilot graduates go on to aviation industry careers. Freshmen at DSU find a personalized experience right from the start, with an Individual Development Plan (IDP) to not only ensure academic success, but also to encourage professional development. Throughout their journeys, students also benefit from faculty members' years of professional experience and a multitude of hands-on learning opportunities, including agriculture, natural resources and natural sciences facilities and laboratories; art and mass communications studios; the University's own music record label; and internships with leading businesses and agencies. For students interested in studying abroad, collaborative partnerships with institutions in Asia, Africa, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean create a wide range of options. Delaware State University is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE). Its Department of Social Work offers the only nationally accredited bachelor's and master's degree program in the state of Delaware, and its business, education, nursing, hospitality and tourism, and food and nutritional science programs also are accredited by specialized academic accrediting agencies. DSU's main campus is a close-knit community situated among 350 acres of modern and historic buildings and sprawling green spaces in Dover, DE. The University also offers convenient and flexible master's degree programs at its location in Wilmington, DE, as well as learning opportunities through its location in Georgetown, DE, and its online bachelor's and master's degree programs. Student-athletes at DSU compete in 18 intercollegiate athletics programs at the NCAA Division I level.

A University of excellence, in which people converges in the search of knowledge with the objective of developing, sharing and using it to the maximum benefit of humanity. It aspires to refine attitudes and skills of its students in a way that they may make a significant contribution to society. Those graduating from our programs will receive an integral preparation that will distinguish them as educated persons that assume leadership \tpositions ...According to this particular mission, the academic offering of the Campus was broadened to include an educational offering ranging from pre-school to doctoral studies. These academic offerings include: 14 Pre-university Technical Certificate Programs, 11 Associates, 45 Bachelors, 3 Professional Certificates, 24 Masters and 6 Doctoral degrees.  The academic offering of the Campus includes a total of 103 academic programs, of which 39 programs are unique to the IAUPR system in Puerto Rico, and 10 are unique in Puerto Rico.  The curriculum responds mainly to the needs of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, as well as responding to an international approach.  An example of the particular offerings include: Graphic Arts, Radiological Technology, Music, and Art, Medical Technology, Applied Mathematics, Biology, Psychology, Education and Entrepreneurial Sciences, among others. According to the Campus Accreditation Plan, 32 percent (37 programs) of the academic programs have been accredited by five national accrediting agencies. In addition, the Continuous Education Program, Childcare Day Center, San German Inter American School (ESGI, for its Spanish acronym) and the Center for Sustainable Student Support (CASA for its Spanish acronym) have achieved professional accreditation.  Programs such as Nursing, Medical Technology, Education, Psychology and Radiologic Technology require that the students approve the Puerto Rico or National Licensing Board exams in order to obtain their license.  The scores obtained are reliable indicators of the assessment of student learning.  Most of our students not only comply with the required scores; furthermore, in most cases the results obtained are above the expected national standard scores.  These assessment results are used for the curriculum evaluation, develop or eliminate courses, and develop new academic programs, among other considerations; they are also used to ensure compliance with the National Accrediting Agencies.  Our campus rated second among the most affordable out of state Universities by Student Loan Hero.  The Carnegie classification of Institutions of Higher Education (CCIHE) for Inter American University of Puerto Rico - San German was upgraded to Doctoral/Professional University.", "totalUndergrads": 3143, "totalGradsAndPros": 567, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 44, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 56}, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": null, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": null}, "vHouOff": [["women's dorms", ""], ["men's dorms", ""], ["apartments for married students", ""], ["apartment for single students", ""], ["special housing for disabled students", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 0, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 0}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 0, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 0}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Not offered", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Not offered", "csAvgCost": 8253, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 7988, "nptMed1": 8705, "nptMed2": 10829, "nptHi1": null, "nptHi2": null}, "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "No", "csTypicalDebt": 9000, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 4750, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 6373, "mdIncDebtMdn": 7000, "hiIncDebtMdn": 8000}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 86, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 25, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "regAlcPermYesno": "No", "vGuiServAva": ["internships", "resume assistance"], "vGuiAddServ": ["placement service", "day care"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Casa Museo Aurelio Ti\u00f3, Museo John Will Harris, Arturo Morales Carrion Research Center", "vProServAva": ["other special classes", "note-taking services", "oral tests", "readers", "extended time for tests", "tutors", "priority seating", "take home exams", "other testing accommodations"], "vGuiSpePgm": ["note-taking services", "reader services", "interpreters for hearing-impaired"], "guidnceCmpsAcsblty": "Mostly"}, {"primaryKey": "2532", "xwalkId": "180461", "urlName": "montana-state", "displayName": "Montana State University", "shortName": "Montana State", "city": "Bozeman", "state": "MT", "zip": "59717", "website": "http://www.montana.edu", "streetAddress1": "Montana State University", "streetAddress2": null, "phone": "(406) 994-0211", "institutionalControl": "public", "privateTuition": "N/A", "inStateTuition": ["$7,520", "(2021-22)"], "outStateTuition": ["$26,950", "(2021-22)"], "roomAndBoard": ["$10,400", "(2021-22)"], "enrollment": ["14,240", "(fall 2020)"], "latitude": 45.6603, "longitude": -111.0461, "applicationDeadline": "rolling", "usnews_category": "2", "ranks": {"national-universities_overall": "#263", "national-universities_social-mobility": "#351", "national-universities_top-public": "#132", "engineering-doctorate_overall": "#131", "nursing_overall": "#96"}, "topMajors": [["Business/Commerce, General", 11], ["Registered Nursing/Registered Nurse", 9], ["Mechanical Engineering", 6], ["Psychology, General", 4], ["Chemical Engineering", 4], ["Biology/Biological Sciences, General", 4], ["Family and Consumer Sciences/Human Sciences, General", 4], ["Computer Science", 3], ["Civil Engineering, General", 3], ["Cell/Cellular Biology and Histology", 3]], "cSelectClass": "More selective", "rCAcceptRate": 81, "gClassSizes": {"vClasses1": 46.7, "vClasses2": 41.4, "vClasses3": 12}, "vStudentFacultyRatio": "17:1", "gradRate4Year": 29, "gStudentGenderDistribution": {"vPctUnderMen": 53, "vPctUnderWomen": 47}, "totalAllStudents": 16249, "association": "NCAA I", "g_financial_aid_statistics": {"pctApplyFinAid": 64.2, "pctNeedFullyMet": 28.5, "pctRecvAidFt": 40, "pctSelfHelpFt": 30.7, "avgPctNeedMetFt": 69}, "vInStateTuition": 7520, "vOutStateTuition": 26950, "wRoomBoard": 10400, "guiAddServIns": "Yes", "schoolStatementText": "In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, Montana State University has transitioned its courses to online and remote teaching methods for the remainder of the academic year and has made many other changes to protect the safety and health of our students, campus and visitors.

An educational leader in the heart of the fourth-largest metropolitan area in the nation (Dallas-Arlington-Fort Worth), UTA nurtures minds within an environment that values innovation, diversity, excellence, access and student success. Ranked the third fastest growing public doctoral institution by the Chronicle of Higher Education, the University's more than 60,000 students pursue 178 bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in a broad range of disciplines. University researchers are working to solve the world's urgent challenges, such as enhancing the human condition, enabling a sustainable megacity and ensuring environmental stability through production of cleaner energy, air and water. The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education classifies UTA as an \"R-1: Very High Research Activity\" doctoral-granting institution, among 131 such elite universities in the U.S. By encouraging a climate of innovation, UTA is making major breakthroughs that drive the economy and offer hope for future generations. The University is home to 18 National Academy of Inventors fellows, the most of any university in Texas. More than 100 patents have been issued over the last five years and more than 20 start-up companies are developing around UTA technologies. Other inventions are being successfully licensed to outside companies, many of which maintain a strong relationship with the University. The high-energy physics group, which is rapidly expanding its profile in many international programs, played a key role in discovering the elusive Higgs boson that physicists believe gives particles in the universe their mass. UTA's College of Nursing and Health Innovation is the top producer of baccalaureate-degreed nurses in the state and one of only 17 universities nationwide to be named a 2020 NLN Center of Excellence by the National League for Nursing. The College of Education is only the second institution in Texas to complete national accreditation through the Association for Advancing Quality in Educator Preparation while also retaining our NCATE/CAEP accreditation. State-of-the-art facilities include the UTA Research Institute, which bridges the gap between academic research and product development in product engineering, biomedical technologies and robotics. The Shimadzu Institute for Research Technologies encompasses more than 47,000 square feet of space and instrumentation spread over six centers. Student success is a primary focus at UTA. The University awarded 13,910 graduate and undergraduate degrees in the 2019-20 academic year, expanding the pool of well-educated employees for knowledge-based industries in North Texas and beyond. Close to 10,000 students live on or adjacent to campus, producing a thriving and rich campus experience and driving demand for new businesses and services. U.S. News & World Report assigned UTA the fifth highest index score in the nation for undergraduate diversity, with Hispanics (31 percent), African-Americans (14.9 percent) and Asians (12.8 percent) representing the largest undergraduate minority groups. The University is a Hispanic-Serving Institution and is ranked as the top four-year college in the nation for veterans on Military Times' Best for Vets list. UTA was named among the top 200 schools for Native Americans by Winds of Change magazine. Students from every U.S. state and more than 100 countries make UTA their collegiate home, creating a global learning environment.", "totalUndergrads": 35064, "totalGradsAndPros": 13008, "pctPell":

Alliant students are multicultural, international, engaged and very much in tune with the needs and challenges of this world.  They value real-world experience as much as textbooks. They see community engagement as a natural extension of their training and education. They attempt to solve the real issues and most pressing challenges of today's world. They strive to understand and connect with the cultures that surround them, so that they can be effective both in their personal and professional lives.  Exposure to this wealth of diverse experiences will help shape students into a more culturally- refined individual, while still sharing the one thing that all of our students have in common: A desire to better the world. A combination of classes, seminars, and hands-on field placements prepares students to their careers.  Students are also be prepared to continue their education at the master's and doctoral levels.  Fast-Track options allow students to spend the last undergraduate year taking 'bridge classes.'

It is located on Crowley's Ridge in Jonesboro. A Carnegie Research 2 university, A-State hosts the first osteopathic medical school in Arkansas, the New York Institute of Technology's College of Osteopathic Medicine, and opened the first U.S.-style residential campus in Mexico in fall of 2017. With its new #Discover2025 Strategic Plan as its guide, A-State is engaged in creating new collaboration opportunities including the Center for No Boundaries Thinking and exploring a public-private partnership to bring the first College of Veterinary Medicine to the state. Undergraduate experiences are highlighted for the last decade with the Create@State spring conference. Create@State participants have an advantage in achieving the graduate school of their choice, including continuing to advanced degrees at A-State. Research opportunities alongside our faculty are not the exception at A-State. Whether it is performing experiments at the Arkansas Biosciences Institute at A-State or assisting with research studies in other laboratory spaces, hands-on work usually associated with graduate school is common for our students. A-State begins its second decade offering online curriculum and course work, and remains the largest provider of 100% online degree programs based in the state with more than 40 degree programs. Combined with hosting the region's first convention center, the Red Wolf Convention Center and Embassy Suites hotel, a one-mile radius on the A-State campus serves as the cultural hub of the region with the largest concert venue, First National Bank Arena, as well as the largest concert hall and theatre located at Fowler Center. The Bradbury Art Museum is the region's leading visual arts facility. Arkansas State's Heritage Sites program operates four nationally or internationally known museum locations including the Johnny Cash Boyhood Home and the Hemingway-Pfeiffer Museum. And, the Arkansas State Museum located adjacent to the Dean B. Ellis Library is home to natural history artifacts of the Northeast Arkansas region. Among our academic divisions, the Neil Griffin College of Business is the first named college, and is home to the Delta Center for Economic Development, the Bob Wood Sales Leadership Center, the Women's Leadership Center, and one of the top rated online MBA programs in the region. One of the region's centers of excellence in media and communication, Arkansas State's School of Media and Journalism is home to an accredited media program whose students regularly take home national awards, the oldest NPR-member radio station west of the Mississippi (KASU) and celebrates in 2021 a century-long tradition of a student-run newspaper, The Herald. A-State's College of Nursing and Health Professions is nationally known with collaborative arrangements with NYIT's on-campus medical school. The College of Engineering and Computer Science is home to the Hytrol Materials Handling Laboratory. Making the campus a safe and welcoming place to live is a high priority. Arkansas State became the first Arkansas institution designated as a Bicycle Friendly University by the League of American Bicyclists in 2014, and in 2018 was upgraded to Silver status. A-State became the largest National Weather Service StormReady Campus in the state of Arkansas, and recently was cited as having one of the top 25 university police departments in the country. With a diverse student body from across the nation and around the world, and more than 100,000 alumni, A-State is the home of the Red Wolves, a Bowl Championship Series Division I athletic program with nine consecutive bowl appearances and numerous Sun Belt Conference titles across its 16 NCAA varsity sports. A-State also sponsors nationally competitive club sport teams like rugby, softball, competitive cheer and dance, and Esports that have earned national titles or national runner-up titles in recent years.", "totalUndergrads": 8486, "totalGradsAndPros": 4620, "pctPell": 41, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 39, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 61}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 1.4, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": null, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": null}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", ""], ["women's dorms", ""], ["men's dorms", ""], ["sorority housing", ""], ["fraternity housing", ""], ["apartment for single students", ""], ["other housing options", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 0, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 0}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 0, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 0}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Not offered", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Not offered", "csAvgCost": 13406, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 10948, "nptMed1": 11672, "nptMed2": 14235, "nptHi1": 15613, "nptHi2": 16640}, "netPriceCalculator": "http://www.astate.edu/a/finaid/tuition-fees/net-price-calculator/index.dot  ", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 21250, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 9500, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 15884, "mdIncDebtMdn": 15000, "hiIncDebtMdn": 14600}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 203, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 50, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 1246, "regAlcPermYesno": "No", "vGuiServAva": ["on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "women's center", "placement service", "day care", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Student patrols", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "ASU Museum; Bradbury Art Museum; Arkansas Biosciences Institute; Arkansas Small Business and Technology Center; Beck PRIDE Center for Veterans; Cooper Alumni Center; Delta Center for Economic Development; Delta STEM Education Center; Centennial Bank Stadium/Allison Field; Fowler Center; P-20 Educational Innovation Center; First National Bank Arena; Student Activity Center; H.O.W.L.

We prepare learners to succeed in a diverse and ever-changing world through customizable academic programs that respond to the needs of the communities where they will live, work, serve and lead. As they master the substantive professional, experiential and practical skills required to excel in the 21st century, students are guided by four Franciscan values - creating a caring community, making peace, showing compassion, reverencing all of creation - that are at the heart of the Stritch experience. Rooted in the liberal arts, Stritch offers more than 60 undergraduate and graduate programs for students of various ages, backgrounds and professional aspirations. They benefit from superior instruction and personal attention from faculty and staff who are dedicated to students' quality education and future success. Our faculty model and promote meaningful integration of theory and practice. In keeping true to the Franciscan values, the University fosters the moral, spiritual, intellectual, cultural, emotional, social and physical development of each student. Our holistic approach to educating today's students for tomorrow's careers leverages Stritch's distinctive diversity and builds upon our commitment to student success. The student experience, inside and outside the classroom, is enhanced through expansive interdisciplinary learning opportunities and increased multi-disciplinary options. Our graduates have the knowledge, skills and disposition necessary to thrive in an evolving global society. The College of Undergraduate Studies is home to associate and bachelor's degree programs for traditional and adult learners. Our innovative undergraduate curriculum offers academic majors and concentrations that align with students' interests and career goals. While academic programs vary in content and direction, they are grounded in shared core values and liberal arts disciplines. Our low faculty-to-student ratio ensures a rich, satisfying and personalized experience, while individualized academic advising helps students build plans that outline their path to graduation and a vision for the future. Our interdisciplinary approach to inquiry-based learning develops critical and creative thinkers, effective communicators, inquisitive learners and individuals who understand and respect the responsibilities of community. Foundational core courses and hands-on professional experiences integrate the skills needed in the workplace of tomorrow. Graduate programs offer theoretical foundations and practical applications designed to prepare students to further their careers and deepen their knowledge. Students who enroll in the College of Graduate Studies are committed to advancing their careers, expanding their professional networks, and becoming leaders who are catalysts for the transformation of individuals, organizations and communities. Cross-cultural and critical thinking skills are hallmarks of the curriculum in each graduate program. Stritch remains at the forefront of advances in the health care industry, responding to the great demand for professionals trained to care for the body and mind. Since 1980, the Ruth S. Coleman College of Nursing and Health Sciences has stayed ahead of the curve, providing cutting-edge education to generations of health care practitioners.

IUP also offers many pioneering programs, including the country's first minor in teamwork, as well as in-demand majors such as nursing, safety sciences, the STEM fields, and Homeland Security. In 2019, IUP opened its University College, which allows first-year students to begin their studies by learning about their options for majors before they ultimately choose one. IUP also offers opportunities such as the Undergraduate Summer Opportunities for Applying Research (U-SOAR) program, where undergraduate students do graduate-level research with a faculty member throughout the summer and then present their findings to their peers.IUP has been honored with several institutional accolades. It has been a fixture in the Princeton Review's \"Best Colleges\" list as well as being named a \"Best for Vets\" college by Military Times.IUP has two affiliate campuses, in Punxsutawney and Northpointe (Freeport), Pennsylvania, and it also offers professional training at the IUP Criminal Justice Training Center as well as the IUP Academy of Culinary Arts.

In November 1882, the school was moved to Jackson; in March 1899, the curriculum was expanded and the name was changed to Jackson College.The state assumed support of the college in 1940, assigning to it the mission of training teachers. Subsequently, between 1953 and 1956, the curriculum was expanded to include a graduate program and bachelors programs in the arts and sciences; the name was then changed to Jackson State College in 1956.Further expansion of the curriculum and a notable building program preceded the elevation of Jackson State College to university status on March 15, 1974. In 1979, Jackson State was officially designated the Urban University of the State of Mississippi. Presently, Jackson State University, a public, coeducational institution, is supported by legislative appropriations supplemented by student fees and federal and private grants.Designated as a high research activity university, Jackson State continues to enhance the state, nation and world through comprehensive economic development, healthcare, technological and educational initiatives. We value our alumni and friends who help to make us great.We have assembled an amazing group of people throughout our four campuses, including some of the best students in the nation and a world-class faculty and staff.

the world. The secret to its success lies in a solid commitment to biblical truth. Upon this foundation, Liberty has built a world-class university that offers excellent academics, NCAA Division I athletics, an exciting social atmosphere, and an environment that encourages spiritual growth. With more than 300 unique areas of study, Liberty is approved by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia and is accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). Liberty's 6,800-acre campus is undergoing an extensive $400 million dollar rebuilding, including the construction of the Jerry Falwell Library, the first building to bear the name of the university's founder, Dr. Jerry Falwell, Sr. Also included in the expansion is The Center for Medical and Health Sciences which will house the new School of Osteopathic Medicine, several new academic buildings, a cathedral-style prayer chapel, and additional athletic facilities. For students who live on campus, Liberty has several options with a variety of resident amenities, including laundry facilities, fully equipped kitchens, en suite bathrooms, and a plethora of dining options. The LaHaye Student Center includes a theater, basketball courts, and an NCAA regulation-size pool. More than 12,600 resident students study at Liberty representing over 80 countries and all 50 states. Liberty invites new students to take a closer look at the university by attending College For A Weekend (CFAW) events.

This is ultimately measured by how effectively we help students secure meaningful and sustainable employment or graduate school admissions and how well we set graduates on a path toward upward mobility and positively impacting their communities. What sets NLU apart is our steadfast commitment to: providing equity of access to higher education through intentionally broad access admissions and affordable tuition; closing the opportunity gap in degree attainment through a personalized academic experience and robust wraparound support to empower students to succeed; and, promoting the economic mobility for our graduates through embedded professional preparation across the academic experience. We provide educational opportunity for all students, including many students from historically underserved populations, as our students are majority Latinx and Black, first-generation college-goers, and low-income. Our Undergraduate College offers a rigorous, professionally focused, supportive bachelor's degree for little or no out-of-pocket cost for students qualifying for financial aid. Our model provides undergraduate students with an affordable, individualized degree program through a blended-flipped classroom model and flexible course schedule with day-time, evening, weekend, blended, and online course options that allow students to balance the realities of family and work responsibilities with being a full-time or part-time student. We offer a personalized educational experience with small class sizes, an adaptive and hands-on curriculum, and success coaches coupled with comprehensive/wrap-around supports such as a food pantry, counseling, and emergency fund to help students stay on-track every step of the way. Every student is also provided with a scaffolded set of career-related experiences (e.g., mock interviews and job shadows), coursework focused on career readiness skills, and in conjunction with our Career Bridge, a comprehensive array of support services to secure required internships, interact with potential employers, create/submit competitive resumes, and practice interviewing skills to obtain a job.NLU's goal is that students will graduate on time, with little/no debt, and with the competitive preparation/skills needed for meaningful, sustainable careers upon graduation.NLU has been recognized for our innovation and impact as we work to accomplish our mission, including: Top 10 Universities who are \"Making the world a better place\" Money Magazine; 76+ Golden Apple Winners -- More than any other school of education in Illinois; U.S. Government Recognition - Patriot Award and Military Friendly; \"New Urban University\" - Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Recognition; 2017 Online Learning Consortium Digital Innovation Award Winner; 2018 Eduventures Innovation Award Winner; Recognized as a leading national university in diversity.  Just this year NLU was recognized by the Online Learning Consortium with an Effective Practice award for innovations in data-driven and student/faculty-centered approaches to delivering undergraduate programs online.  NLU's main campus is in Chicago, and we have satellite campuses in the surrounding suburbs and in Florida. In 2020/21, National Louis University served over 10,000 students: 45% of them undergraduates and 55% graduate students, with 56% identifying as a minority.  59% of undergraduate students were first

Workship is Palm Beach Atlantic University's award-winning community service program that responds to human needs with Christ-like action in the community and the world. Through community service, students can discern their vocation and develop a lifelong habit of servant leadership. In 1984, PBA established American Free Enterprise Day to honor individuals who have embraced and endorsed the principles of the free enterprise system. American Free Enterprise Day is celebrated every November on campus with a special event attended by community leaders, faculty, staff and students. The aim is to develop in each of our students an appreciation for the unique American achievement in its many dimensions: social, political, economic, moral, legal and religious. In addition, PBA has established five Centers of Excellence, best defined as areas of focus that allow select and highly motivated students to gain special knowledge and expertise in specific fields. The Centers of Excellence are: The LeMieux Center for Public Policy, the Gregory Center for Medical Missions, the Rinker Center for Experiential Learning, the Center for Integrative Science Learning and the Titus Center for Franchising.", "totalUndergrads": 2916, "totalGradsAndPros": 788, "pctPell": 35, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 35, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 65}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 3.1, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 47, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 53}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", ""], ["women's dorms", ""], ["men's dorms", ""], ["theme housing", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 0, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 0}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 0, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 0}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Not offered", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered at cooperating institution", "vRotcOffNavy": "Not offered", "csAvgCost": 25887, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 23101, "nptMed1": 21318, "nptMed2": 25669, "nptHi1": 26476, "nptHi2": 29954}, "netPriceCalculator": "http://www.pba.edu/net-price-calculator", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 22250, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 8250, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 14750, "mdIncDebtMdn": 18500, "hiIncDebtMdn": 14933}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 212, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 28831, "pctIncuredDebt": 61, "vGiBill": 2, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 45, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "envCamSize": 101, "regAlcPermYesno": "No", "vGuiServAva": ["on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Helen K.

From its beginning, Roosevelt pioneered the concept of making higher education available to all students who could qualify academically regardless of their social or economic class, racial or ethnic origin, sex, or age.  This ideal attracted Albert Einstein, Albert Schweitzer, Eleanor Roosevelt, Marian Anderson, and Pearl Buck to the University's first advisory board. Today, Roosevelt remains dedicated to the enlightenment of the human spirit through educating socially conscious citizens for active and dedicated lives as leaders in their professions and their communities.In fall 2012, a new 32-story building, the second tallest academic structure in the U.S., opened on Roosevelt's Chicago Campus.  The top 15 floors of this building provide 500 students with on-campus housing facilities and stunning views of Lake Michigan and Chicago's architecturally acclaimed downtown. In addition to the residence hall, the building also houses state-of-the art labs and classrooms, a student union, and a fitness center.A new student recreational center and field house also opened during the 2012-13 academic year on the Chicago Campus. Roosevelt has campus locations in Chicago, Schaumburg, Waukegan, Peoria, and Palatine where the University offers degree completion programs at Harper Community College's University Center. In addition, Roosevelt offers fully online degree programs, now including an MBA, along with a wide-array of online course offerings.In the spring of 2020, Robert Morris University of Illinois was integrated into Roosevelt University. Roosevelt now offers more majors which include nursing and graphic design, among others. In addition, new sports such as football, men's and women's hockey, and e-sports are now offered.

With more than 22,000 students, 300-plus degree programs and a central location in metropolitan Akron, UA is at the heart of the region's educational and economic resurgence. UA emphasizes interdisciplinary studies, career-focused programs and experiential learning - valuing the arts and humanities as well as science and technology. The focus is on educating a diverse population of students, preparing them for rewarding careers and building the regional economy. UA has a century-old reputation for preparing students for professional careers, thanks in part to one of the longest running co-op programs in the nation, incorporating hands-on learning into the curriculum. From polymers and psychology, to engineering and communications, to business and education, UA brings together diverse fields of study in ways that provide students with the skills that employers value.The distinctive Akron Experience creates a personalized path for each UA student. It includes internships and co-ops, academic research (both undergraduate and graduate), study abroad, on-campus student employment and service projects. The goal of these experiences is to better prepare students for post-graduation success and a lifetime of achievement. It looks beyond the college years by linking learning in the classroom and research labs with career-related opportunities. Students learn real-world, problem-solving skills that not only ensure academic achievement, but also enhance personal and professional success.With more than $41 million in research expenditures, The University of Akron is also known as the public research university for Northeast Ohio and is recognized as a world leader in advanced materials research. UA is focused on innovation, entrepreneurship, and investment in community and economic growth. By building on its established leadership position, and engaging in innovative partnerships with business, industry and education, UA advances economic development and spurs job creation in Ohio and throughout the nation. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching recently recognized UA's partnerships with the community as the only Northeast Ohio public university to have earned a Community Engagement Classification in both Curricular Engagement and Outreach and Partnerships.The University of Akron is classified at the highest level as a comprehensive, doctoral-degree-granting institution.

Our location defines us: what we are, what we teach and what we research. Our focus is the circumpolar North and its diverse peoples, with classrooms and labs that extend beyond our campus - from arctic tundra to alpine slopes to temperate rain forests, from the Arctic Ocean to the Bering Sea and the entire North Pacific. As Alaskas top teaching and research university, and the states only Ph.D.-granting institution, our programs attract and retain world-class faculty. Their work is published in academic journals and the popular press, and theyre sought after around the world for their expertise. That means the instruction you receive at UAF is highly regarded nationally and internationally. UAF has seven urban and rural campuses, and comprises eight college and schools. Although you will choose a major within one of them, you can take classes in others. Diversify your learning in engineering and mines, liberal arts, natural science and mathematics, rural and community development, education, fisheries and ocean sciences, management, and natural resources and agricultural sciences. With more than 360 million acres of possibilities to explore, field work really takes place in the field, on the glacier or up the mountain. A lab could have a supercomputer or ancient artifacts. And the work addresses real issues, like helping develop rural businesses, predict natural disasters or treat diabetes. Were a university, but our teaching environments are more like what youd find at a small college, offering private-school attention at a public school price. Undergraduates get one-on-one time with faculty members, even collaborating on advanced research, but your most valuable and memorable experiences may come from classmates whose backgrounds contrast with yours. UAF students come from all over Alaska, the United States and the world, and are of many ethnic, religious, cultural and language groups. We also enroll many nontraditional students. Some are returning to the classroom after raising a family or pursuing a career, and some hold full-time jobs while working toward a certificate or degree. Each student has a different perspective and unique background, making for an energetic mix and lively classroom discussions. At UAF youll learn in a close-knit community where teaching and research are balanced with campus activities and traditions, lasting friendships, and outdoor adventures. Youll have plenty of options to stay busy. Experience the Last Frontier up close and personal through our Outdoor Adventures program, take a leadership role with student government or the dynamic Leadership Program, be a DJ at the campus radio station, or tackle one of the best climbing walls in the state at the Student Recreation Center. Join an intramural sports team, or cheer on one of our eight intercollegiate athletic teams. The average weekend on campus features a full slate of concerts, plays, film festivals and other events to keep you busy until Monday. (Just dont forget to do your homework.) Students come to UAF to explore, and to get more out of college, a degree out of life. Theres passive learning, and then theres active learning. Want active learning?

As Americas Leadership University, we are deeply devoted to our mission:The University of Mary exists to serve the religious, academic and cultural needs of the people in this region and beyond. It takes its tone from the commitment of the Sisters of Annunciation Monastery. These Sisters founded the University in 1959 and continue to sponsor it today. It is Christian, it is Catholic, and it is Benedictine.We cherish our Christian, Catholic, Benedictine identity; we welcome and serve persons of all faiths. We are faithfully Christian. As a Christian university, we strive to accomplish our mission in faithfulness to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We regard each human person as created in the image and likeness of God, gifted with life and dignity. We seek to be agents of cultural renewal in our time and place, courageous advocates for justice and peace. Our Christian commitment is born from and sustained by the encounter of the Risen Lord, who came not to be served but to serve. As He humbly washed the feet of His disciples on the night before He died, so we seek to serve one another. We are faithfully Christian. We are joyfully Catholic. As a Catholic university, we joyfully draw our life from the heart of the Church, identifying with the ancient tradition which gave rise to the first universities in medieval Europe. This Catholic intellectual tradition proposes an integrated spiritual and philosophical approach to the most enduring questions of human life. Thus we seek to advance the vital dialogue between faith and reason, while acknowledging the proper autonomy of the arts, sciences, and professions. A university is a place for the free exchange of ideas, and so we warmly welcome students and faculty of many faiths and convictions. At the same time, our common discourse ever takes place in a spirit of authentic respect for Catholic teaching and practice. We acknowledge the Catholic faith as a path to moral integrity and personal holiness. We are joyfully Catholic.We are gratefully Benedictine. As a Benedictine university, we remember with gratitude the Benedictine Sisters who came to Dakota Territory in 1878, bringing ministries of teaching and healing. This community of Sisters would become our founders and sponsors and, through them, we share in the 1500-year-old heritage of the Benedictines. Inspired by lives of prayer, community, and service, Saint Benedict and his spiritual followers through the ages have been a stable source of tremendous good in the world: renewing the Church, preserving learning, cultivating wisdom, modeling humane virtues of balance and generosity. The life of our Sisters shapes our life.

The university offers more than 100 undergraduate and 100 graduate programs, including signature programs in nursing, business, performing and visual arts, sport and exercise science and education. Its 260-acre campus is located in Greeley, Colorado, about one hour north of Denver, with extended campus locations in Loveland, Denver and Colorado Springs.

university that is a haven for the arts with a tradition of success in both academics and athletics.  Southern Miss has a diverse student body of approximately 16,000 students from 67 foreign countries, all regions of the United States and every corner of Mississippi.  We offer more than 180 undergraduate and graduate degree programs in six degree-granting colleges.  A dual-campus university, Southern Miss serves students on campuses in Hattiesburg and Long Beach, in addition to five teaching and research sites in Mississippi.  Our  students gain international experience through our study-abroad programs in 21 countries.  As the premier research university of the Gulf South, Southern Miss takes pride in being classified as a RU/H: Research University (high research activity) by the Carnegie Foundation for the advancement of teaching among doctorate-granting universities.  The Center for Undergraduate Research affords our students meaningful research opportunities, and as a proven leader in innovation, we conduct trans-formative research.  In fact, one of our research projects was one of only two nationwide selected by NASA to be conducted on the International Space Station to discover if life can survive on Mars.  The Center for Gulf Studies, administered through the Southern Miss Department of Marine Science at Stennis Space Center, seeks to serve the people of Mississippi, the northern Gulf region and the country with a scientifically based understanding of ecosystem status and trends with special emphasis on improved forecasting abilities to ensure sustainable coastal and ocean ecosystems of the Gulf of Mexico.  Our National Center for Spectator Sports Safety and Security offers solutions for the security of sports stadiums and arenas that have been identified as potential targets of terrorism.  The School of Polymers and High Performance Materials is creating new polymer materials used in everyday products such as cosmetics, ship building and sports equipment, and is partnering with GE Aviation to focus on composites development processing for the GEnx aircraft engine.  Our students contributed more than 91,000 hours of volunteer service to the surrounding community last year.  In addition, our university has been honored with the prestigious Carnegie Community Engagement Classification for the many ways in which our students, faculty, staff and programs engage and enhance the people and places of South Mississippi and beyond.  The university is one of a select number of institutions in the nation accredited in all four arts disciplines: theatre, dance, art and music.  The Southern Miss School of Music produces more than 300 performances each year featuring world-renowned guest artists and faculty/student performances, providing experiences unparalleled in the region.  Guest artists have included Placido Domingo, Yo-Yo Ma, Sir James Galway and Joshua Bell.  Southern Miss has a long history of achieving on the field and in the classroom.  The Department of Athletics offers 16 sport programs at the Division I level sponsored by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and weve won five Conference USA football championships and three Conference USA baseball championships.  We are also continually recognized for having the highest graduation rate in the state among mens athletics programs.  Recently, Southern Miss accounted for the Truman Scholarship winner from a Mississippi university.  Since 2006, Southern Miss students have collected seven Goldwater Scholarships, three Truman Scholarships, 10 National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowships and numerous other prestigious awards.", "totalUndergrads": 11451, "totalGradsAndPros": 3155, "pctPell": 47, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 36, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 64}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": 6.6,

As one of the largest Hispanic-Serving Institutions in the country, UTRGV is home to internationally recognized folkloric music, dance programs, and a broad range of Latin and Hispanic studies. From the Gulf Coast to deep space, UTRGV offers a dynamic learning environment featuring more than 135 undergraduate, graduate, and professional degrees spanning the arts and sciences. Prominent programs include education, engineering, marine biology, hospitality and tourism management, sustainable agriculture and food systems, international business, nursing, and sports medicine.Poised to be the first institution in Texas with schools of medicine, pharmacy, and podiatry, UTRGV students are ready to meet the world's healthcare needs. When COVID-19 struck, UT Health RGV, the School of Medicine's (SOM) clinical practice, responded by developing a reliable testing process and became one of the first to offer such services in the Rio Grande Valley. To date, UT Health RGV and the SOM have conducted more than 100,000 COVID-19 tests and administered more than 60,000 COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic. Distinguished as the only medical school in Texas south of San Antonio, the SOM is a preeminent partner in medical training for more than 450 students, residents, and fellows currently serving in 19 hospital-based programs.Transcending borders, UTRGV's Center for Gravitational Wave Astronomy (CGWA) boasts direct involvement with the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) project, a collaboration of over 1,000 researchers from more than 20 countries. UTRGV's CGWA has the largest group of gravitational-wave researchers in Texas and one of the largest in the U.S. involved in the LIGO Scientific Collaboration global research effort. Researchers at UTRGV's CGWA were integral to the first direct detection of gravitational waves, which earned LIGO's founders the 2017 Nobile Prize in Physics.Renowned for academics and research, UTRGV is also home to the Vaqueros, Western Athletic Conference (WAC) champions, and a thriving campus environment. With 16 NCAA Division I programs and nearly 150 student organizations, a recent survey showed overwhelming positivity and satisfaction among UTRGV students during the 2020-2021 academic year.Dedicated to promoting student success, UTRGV awards approximately $250 million in financial aid annually and offers guaranteed tuition plans, which means a student's tuition will not increase for four years. UTRGV also caps tuition charges at 12 credit hours, which means any additional course(s) a student enrolls in after 12 credit hours is/are free.Recording Breaking EnrollmentMore than 32,000 students enrolled at UTRGV for Fall 2020, the most in school history.Least Student DebtRanked first in Texas (second nationally) by U.S. News & World Report among public institutions for least student debt (2021).UTRGV Tuition AdvantageUnparalleled in Texas and one of the most generous programs nationwide, UTRGV Tuition Advantage provides free tuition and fees for qualifying students from families with an adjusted gross income of $95,000 or less.Vaqueros MD Early Assurance ProgramFor high-achieving students who graduate from high schools across South Texas, this program helps incoming Freshmen create a direct path to admission into the UTRGV School of Medicine within four years.Back-to-Back-to-Back National Chess ChampsUTRGV captured its third-straight President's Cup (2018, 2019, 2021),

traditional liberal arts education.  Our commitment to traditional values is reflected by our undergraduate curriculum which provides the foundation for a deeper understanding of advanced studies.  Cumberland graduates enjoy a high acceptance rate to graduate and professional schools. Of course, one of the major reasons for the success of our students is that we require more than just academic success for their degree.  We also require that each student help his/her fellowman by volunteering a minimum of 40 hours of community service hours before graduation.  The Leadership and Community Service Program helps us to fulfill our mission of preparing students for lives of ethical and responsible leadership.
