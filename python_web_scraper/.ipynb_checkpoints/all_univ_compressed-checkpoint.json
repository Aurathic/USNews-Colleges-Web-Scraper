Through its commitment to ensuring all students can graduate with little or no debt, all students who are accepted can rely on Princeton's financial aid program to meet their financial need so they can attend and thrive at the University. More than ever, Princeton seeks to enroll the most talented students from a broad spectrum of cultural, ethnic and economic backgrounds. Students' experiences inside and outside the classroom prepare them for service, leadership and lifelong learning. Princeton emphasizes creativity, innovation and collaboration with a program of liberal arts in the humanities, arts, social sciences, natural sciences and engineering. Princeton's low student-to-faculty ratio means students are able to develop close working relationships with professors, who are leaders in their fields. We expect every faculty member to teach, and we expect every student to do original, creative research. Our approximately 5,300 undergraduate students are part of a vibrant campus community, and students stay connected to a Princeton community that spans the globe long after they have graduated. Students are encouraged to explore many academic and extracurricular opportunities while taking advantage of the University's extraordinary facilities and resources. We are a community of learning that is enriched by the varied experiences and perspectives of and engagement between our students, faculty and staff. Classrooms are filled with students and faculty from a wide range of backgrounds from across the country and around the world, and students benefit from the interdisciplinary connections at the core of Princeton's curriculum.

a dozen graduate and professional schools and the over 6,000 undergraduates studying in Columbia College and The Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science.  The renowned Core Curriculum unites all Columbia undergraduates by providing a common foundation in literature, philosophy, science, art, history and music, and caps classes at 22 students to afford close interaction with Columbias renowned faculty. Columbia Engineering is one of the oldest engineering schools in the U.S., developing future engineering leaders through its unique educational approach which includes a first-year hands-on design course; close student-to-faculty interaction with extensive undergraduate research opportunities starting as early as the first year; a broad-based core curriculum, liberal arts minors and interdisciplinary courses; programs and projects that foster entrepreneurship and socially-responsible innovation; and trailblazing internship and civic engagement programs in New York City and around the world. Students choose among over 100 majors and concentrations and thousands of research, internship and job opportunities.Located in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, Columbia not only offers access to all of New York City, the ultimate classroom, but also guaranteed four-year housing within a traditional campus surrounded by a residential neighborhood lined with bookstores, cafes and parks. Called \"the quintessential great urban university,\" Columbia is diverse in every way: students come from 50 states and over 100 foreign countries; over half of undergraduates are students of color, and over 300 student organizations are offered, including 34 Division I Ivy League athletic teams and dozens of community service organizations, performance groups, political clubs and publications.As the birthplace of FM radio, the fields of genetics and anthropology, the nations oldest literary magazine and first Black student advocacy group on a multi-racial campus, Columbia has carried on a tradition of both social and scientific innovation for over 250 years. Notable Columbians include Barack Obama, Isaac Asimov, Madeline Albright, Langston Hughes, Jack Kerouac, Julia Stiles, and many more spanning every professional field. Columbia offers extensive need-based financial aid and meets the full need of every student admitted as a first-year with grants instead of loans. Parents with calculated incomes below $60,000 and with typical assets are not expected to contribute any income or assets to tuition, room, board and mandatory fees and families with calculated incomes between $60,000 and $100,000 and with typical assets have a significantly reduced contribution. To support students pursuing study abroad, research, internships and community service opportunities, Columbia offers the opportunity to apply for additional funding and exemptions from academic year and summer work expectations. A commitment to diversity of every kind is a longstanding Columbia hallmark.

intractable, complicated problems whose solutions make a permanent difference. While MIT is a research university committed to world-class inquiry in math, science, and engineering, MIT has equally distinguished programs in architecture, the humanities, management, and the social sciences. A diverse, supportive campus environment--with an incredible range of student groups and athletic and fitness opportunities--ensures that it's not all about the work. And in MIT's intensely creative atmosphere, the arts flourish in all their forms.MIT admits some of the most talented students in the world on a need-blind basis. The Institute is committed to meeting the financial need of each admitted undergraduate student through MIT Scholarships; the estimated average need-based scholarship is $54,601 in 2021-2022. As a result, the MIT community is incredibly diverse, and organically collaborative, with students coming from many different backgrounds, across the country and around the world.Students are frequently encouraged to unite MIT's engineering excellence with public service. For example, the required senior capstone design course for mechanical engineering majors centers on making the world a better place through engineering. Recent years have focused on projects using alternative forms of energy, and machines that could be used for sustainable agriculture. Beyond academic coursework, MIT's D-Lab, Poverty Action Lab, and Public Service Center all support students and professors in the research and implementation of culturally sensitive and environmentally responsible technologies and programs that alleviate poverty and improve quality of life in low-income areas locally, nationally, and worldwide.MIT's preeminence in entrepreneurship is rooted in its founding. As one of the first land-grant colleges, the Institute was designed to deliver a practical education rather than to focus on the classical education that was provided by many private universities of the era. This emphasis on practice is infused into the entrepreneurship curriculum and programming, which emphasizes learning by doing. Over the course of the 2018-2019 academic year, more than 85 entrepreneurship courses were offered.Several MIT departments, labs, and centers foster entrepreneurship and innovation at MIT including the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship, the MIT Sandbox Innovation Fund Program, and the MIT Innovation Initiative to name a few. MIT also has more than 35 student clubs and initiatives involved in entrepreneurship or innovation, among them the MIT $100K Entrepreneurship Competition, MIT Clean Energy Prize, and conferences such as Hacking Arts and Hacking Medicine.The MIT community brings its energy and creativity outside the classroom as well with 450+ student-run groups, 33 varsity sports, 18 intramural sports, 35 club sports, and more than 50 music, theater, visual arts, writing, and dance groups. It's just a short walk across the Charles River to Boston where students can enjoy the city's fabulous restaurants and culture. Many programs around MIT allow students to get reduced-price tickets to various events, including the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the American Repertory Theater, and Bruins, Celtics, and Red Sox games. Students get free admission daily to the Museum of Science, the Museum of Fine Arts, and all Harvard University and MIT museums.", "totalUndergrads": 4361, "totalGradsAndPros": 6893, "pctPell": 19, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 52, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 48}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": null, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": 20, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": 80}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", "99%"], ["women's dorms", ""], ["sorority housing", ""], ["fraternity housing", ""], ["apartments for married students", ""], ["apartment for single students", ""], ["special housing for disabled students", ""], ["cooperative housing", ""], ["theme housing", ""], ["other housing options", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 39, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 61}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 26, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 74}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Offered on campus", "vInStateTuition": null, "vOutStateTuition": null, "csAvgCost": 16636, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": 4535, "nptMed1": 1820, "nptMed2": 6049, "nptHi1": 14381, "nptHi2": 38934}, "netPriceCalculator": "https://npc.collegeboard.org/student/app/mit", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 12500, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 5500, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 6993, "mdIncDebtMdn": 6155, "hiIncDebtMdn": 13000}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 119, "csLoanRepayment": null, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 22735, "pctIncuredDebt": 21, "nptLo": null, "nptMed1": null, "nptMed2": null, "nptHi1": null, "nptHi2": null, "vGiBill": 1, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 9, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "loIncDebtMdn": null, "mdIncDebtMdn": null, "hiIncDebtMdn": null, "loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null, "incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null, "envCamSize": 168, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["nonremedial tutoring", "placement service", "day care", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Dedicated teaching laboratories in many departments are complemented by the facilities of numerous interdisciplinary research laboratories and centers including MIT.nano, Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, MIT Media Lab, SENSEable City Lab, Nuclear Reactor Lab, and the Wright Brothers Wind Tunnel.

Students of all backgrounds, beliefs, identities, and interests join a global intellectual community that values a multifaceted approach to undergraduate education. All undergraduates are enrolled in a single liberal arts college at the heart of the university, offering nearly 2,000 courses and 80 majors. Students begin their academic journey undeclared, with access to all the same courses, and without the restrictions of a core curriculum. Every incoming first-year student is randomly assigned to one of fourteen Residential Colleges. These close-knit communities, housed in stunning buildings centered on green courtyards serve as microcosms of Yale's diverse student population, while preserving the intimacy of a smaller college experience. Yale students mount over 250 theatrical and musical performances each year; write for dozens undergraduate publications; celebrate their identities through numerous religious and cultural groups; and compete on nearly 100 varsity, club, and intramural athletic teams. Students travel to more than 50 foreign countries annually, engaging in scholarship, research, and public service through more than 1,000 internship, fellowship, research, and study abroad opportunities.

Their intent was to establish a \"University of high degree\" that would \"qualify students for personal success and direct usefulness in life and promote the public welfare by exercising an influence on behalf of humanity and civilization.\" Today, Stanford is a leading research university where teaching, learning and research are integral to the university's mission. Stanford values close interaction between undergraduates and faculty. Undergraduate student participation in research is strongly supported and, in 2019-2020, Stanford allocated about $5.9 million to support more than 800 students on a wide range of projects, even with restrictions on travel and on-campus activities. Stanford's entrepreneurial spirit draws from its location on the West Coast and the legacy of its founders. Stanford emphasizes multidisciplinary approaches to teaching and research, and academic excellence crosses disciplines, ranging from humanities to social sciences to engineering and the sciences.  Current faculty members have earned 19 Nobel Prizes and four Pulitzer Prizes. Since the university's founding, 34 Stanford faculty have won the Nobel Prize.

Students apply to one of four undergraduate schools---Arts and Sciences, Nursing, Engineering and Applied Science, or Wharton. Penn also offers an array of exciting interdisciplinary programs and courses which leverage the resources of different departments or schools, such as the Fisher Program in Management and Technology, the Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business, and the Vagelos Program in Life Sciences and Management. Students are strongly encouraged to engage the world beyond Penn, both locally and globally. Civic House provides a \"hub\" for students interested in all kinds of community service while the Center for Community Partnerships coordinates over 150 Academically Based Community Service courses each term which link theory and practice through activities that make a significant difference in West Philadelphia and the City. Opportunities for global engagement include Penn Abroad, through which more than 600 Penn undergraduates each year spend a semester or longer abroad, more than any other Ivy League school. Nearly 15% of our undergraduates come to Penn from other countries, providing a linguistically and culturally diverse environment. As one of the worlds premier research universities, Penn offers students the opportunity to learn by participating in the hands-on creation of new knowledge. The Center for Undergraduate Research, the Kelly Writers House, the Weiss Tech House, and the Penn Museum are places that connect undergraduates to leading researchers at Penn and to the cutting-edge ideas of its laboratories and seminar rooms. The academic experience at Penn is integrated with social and extra-curricular life. Almost all first-year students reside within the eleven College Houses at Penn, which link intellectual and social experiences through close contact with faculty-in-residence and student resident assistants. Penn has over 300 student groups ranging from political action to performing arts to sports clubs to student publications offering all students opportunities to pursue a wide-range of interests. Such opportunities extend beyond campus to the City of Philadelphia where students can experience the rich cultural, athletic, social, and political life of Americas most historic city.

A private comprehensive teaching and research university, Duke traces its roots to 1838, officially becoming Duke University in 1924. In addition to liberal arts and engineering education at the undergraduate level, Duke offers graduate and professional study in arts and sciences, business, divinity, engineering, the environment, law, public policy, medicine, and nursing. At the same time, Duke is an intimate setting, with 6,700 undergraduates and an additional 9,000 graduate and professional students.Duke is a global university with students and faculty from nearly every country. We encourage students to go abroad to study, perform service and conduct research. About half of Dukes graduating class spends at least a semester in another country - one of the highest percentages of any of the nations top private research universities. We offer instruction in 25 foreign languages. One of our most popular programs is DukeEngage, which supports undergraduates who want to pursue an immersive service experience in the U.S. or abroad.       Duke is characterized by innovation, entrepreneurship, energy and ambition. Duke students have an unusually wide range of opportunities available to them and freedom in choosing the academic path that best meets their needs.  Duke students are encouraged to make a difference, to experiment with ideas and organizations and they are challenged to become engaged with society's problems and solutions.     Our students spend four years on one of the most beautiful campuses in America -- soaring Gothic buildings, modern teaching and research facilities, lush botanical gardens, and accessible athletics and recreational spaces.  Dukes home of Durham is a historic tobacco and textile hub that has emerged as the heart of North Carolinas hi-tech Research Triangle, and is consistently recognized as one of the most desirable and vibrant places to live in the country.  Durham's arts, culture, recreation and restaurants have earned a national following, and the region provides numerous opportunities for post-graduate employment.      Duke students exhibit legendary passion and enthusiasm.  Dukes athletic program is regularly ranked among the nations strongest and most competitive, with some of the countrys most talented scholar-athletes and dedicated fans: the Cameron Crazies. A member of the Atlantic Coast Conference, Duke has thirteen men's varsity teams and thirteen women's varsity teams as well as numerous intramural, recreational, and club sports. Duke consistently leads the ACC in Academic Honor Roll students and is a top producer of Academic All Americans.       The residential experience is an important component of a Duke education. About 85 percent of all undergraduates live on campus. First-year students live together on East Campus, where about a quarter of them participate in FOCUS, a living/learning program organized around academic themes, which gives them immediate access to faculty mentoring and a smaller community of students they get to know well.      Duke is one of a small number of schools committed to a need-blind admission policy, which means we admit undergraduates without consideration of a family's ability to pay tuition and other college costs and meet 100 percent of a students demonstrated financial need for four years. About 54 percent of our undergraduates receive some sort of financial assistance, including need-based aid, merit or athletic scholarships.     With the rigorous academics, the plethora of social and artistic activities, the immersive service and cultural opportunities and the occasional basketball game in Cameron Indoor Stadium, the most important things students need to bring with them to Duke are energy and intellectual curiosity.", "totalUndergrads": 6717, "totalGradsAndPros": 9455, "pctPell": 13, "gDegSeekStudentGenderDist": {"webPctMaleDegSeek": 50, "webPctFemaleDegSeek": 50}, "enrollmentMilitaryTotalCyPct": null, "gStudentsOnOffCampus": {"pctUnderOnCampus": null, "stuCatLiveOffCampusUg": null}, "vHouOff": [["coed dorms", ""], ["women's dorms", ""], ["men's dorms", ""], ["apartment for single students", ""], ["theme housing", ""], ["wellness housing", ""]], "gFraternityMembers": {"stuCatFraternityUg": 0, "stuCatNoFraternityUg": 0}, "gSororityMembers": {"stuCatSororityUg": 0, "stuCatNoSororityUg": 0}, "vRotcOffAirforce": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffArmy": "Offered on campus", "vRotcOffNavy": "Offered on campus", "vInStateTuition": null, "vOutStateTuition": null, "csAvgCost": 27020, "csAvgCostIncome": {"nptLo": -7808, "nptMed1": -1314, "nptMed2": 4150, "nptHi1": 18375, "nptHi2": 48680}, "netPriceCalculator": "https://npc.collegeboard.org/student/app/duke", "giBillCertified": "Yes", "yellowRibbonParticipant": "Yes", "csTypicalDebt": 12582, "csTypicalDebtNograduate": 5500, "csTypicalDebtIncome": {"loIncDebtMdn": 12750, "mdIncDebtMdn": 11500, "hiIncDebtMdn": 12000}, "csTypicalLoanPayMonthly": 120, "csLoanRepayment": null, "csLoanRepaymentIncome": {"loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null}, "avgGradDebt": 24219, "pctIncuredDebt": 30, "nptLo": null, "nptMed1": null, "nptMed2": null, "nptHi1": null, "nptHi2": null, "vGiBill": 0, "csPctRcvFedLoan": 29, "csPctRcvFedLoanIncome": {"incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null}, "loIncDebtMdn": null, "mdIncDebtMdn": null, "hiIncDebtMdn": null, "loIncRpy3yrRt": null, "mdIncRpy3yrRt": null, "hiIncRpy3yrRt": null, "incPctLo": null, "incPctM1": null, "incPctM2": null, "incPctH1": null, "incPctH2": null, "envCamSize": null, "regAlcPermYesno": "Yes", "vGuiServAva": ["on-campus job interviews", "internships", "resume assistance", "career/job search classes", "alumni network", "interest inventory", "interview training"], "vGuiAddServ": ["women's center", "placement service", "health service", "health insurance"], "vGuiSaf": ["24-hour foot and vehicle patrols", "Late night transport/escort service", "24-hour emergency telephones", "Lighted pathways/sidewalks", "Student patrols", "Controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.)"], "vComSchProvNet": [], "libSchCamYesno": "Yes", "libMusOther": "Nasher Art Museum", "vProServAva": [], "vGuiSpePgm": ["tape recorders", "tutors", "adaptive equipment", "reader services", "braille services"], "guidnceCmpsAcsblty": "Mostly", "primaryKey": "2920", "xwalkId": "198419", "urlName": "duke-university", "displayName": "Duke University", "shortName": "Duke University", "city": "Durham", "state": "NC", "zip": "27708", "website": "http://www.duke.edu/", "streetAddress1": "2138 Campus Drive, Box 90586", "streetAddress2": null, "phone": "(919) 684-2724", "institutionalControl": "private", "privateTuition": ["$60,489", "(2021-22)"], "inStateTuition": "N/A", "outStateTuition": "N/A", "roomAndBoard": ["$17,484", "(2021-22)"], "enrollment": ["6,717", "(fall 2020)"], "latitude": 35.9991, "longitude": -78.9382, "usnews_category": "2", "ranks": {"national-universities_overall": 9, "national-universities_undergraduate-teaching": 13, "national-universities_best-value": 13, "national-universities_innovative": 16, "national-universities_social-mobility": 312, "engineering-doctorate_overall": 27, "engineering-doctorate_biological-biomedical": 4, "computer-science_biocomputing-bioinformatics-biotechnology": 6, "nursing_overall": 2}}}
