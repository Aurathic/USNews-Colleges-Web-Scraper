Through its commitment to ensuring all students can graduate with little or no debt, all students who are accepted can rely on Princeton's financial aid program to meet their financial need so they can attend and thrive at the University. More than ever, Princeton seeks to enroll the most talented students from a broad spectrum of cultural, ethnic and economic backgrounds. Students' experiences inside and outside the classroom prepare them for service, leadership and lifelong learning. Princeton emphasizes creativity, innovation and collaboration with a program of liberal arts in the humanities, arts, social sciences, natural sciences and engineering. Princeton's low student-to-faculty ratio means students are able to develop close working relationships with professors, who are leaders in their fields. We expect every faculty member to teach, and we expect every student to do original, creative research. Our approximately 5,300 undergraduate students are part of a vibrant campus community, and students stay connected to a Princeton community that spans the globe long after they have graduated. Students are encouraged to explore many academic and extracurricular opportunities while taking advantage of the University's extraordinary facilities and resources. We are a community of learning that is enriched by the varied experiences and perspectives of and engagement between our students, faculty and staff. Classrooms are filled with students and faculty from a wide range of backgrounds from across the country and around the world, and students benefit from the interdisciplinary connections at the core of Princeton's curriculum. We invite you to explore more about what makes Princeton special and contributes to the transformative experience that is a Princeton education.\n",
